  <p><i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> compiles Nellie Bly's reporting from her
  first undercover assignment for the <i>New York World </i>in 1887. She
  disguised herself as "a crazy person" in order to get herself admitted to the
  Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island (now Roosevelt's Island). She
  spent ten days there as a patient before the <i>World </i>secured her release.
  Her articles led to a grand jury investigation and a major budget expansion
  for New York State asylums.</p>


  <p>While Bly's projects were often framed as stunts— by her paper and others—<i>Ten Days</i> is a serious examination of what happens to women that society finds inconvenient (whether or not they have an illness). Bly describes her experience with frank horror while also deploying her trademark observational humor, trained on the absurdity of the institution and the people who uphold its abuses. Cita's edition positions this landmark text within the tradition of feminist literature about women's experiences with mental illness, mental health treatment, and in mental institutions.</p>

<p>In 1887, on assignment for Joseph Pulitzer’s <i>New York World </i>newspaper, journalist Nellie Bly disguised herself as a “crazy person” in order to get admitted to the Women’s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell’s Island. Considered from today's perspective, this could be seen as a pioneering feat of investigative journalism, although her methods were certainly personal and idiosyncratic. At the time, it was seen as a “stunt” and trumpeted sensationally in brazen headlines (“Feigning Insanity in Order To Reveal Asylum Horrors.”)</p>

<p>Nellie Bly, born Elizabeth Jane Cochran in 1864, began life in relative privilege, but after the death of her father when she was six the family struggled financially. Her mother’s remarriage ended in divorce when her husband became abusive, and Nellie was forced to drop out of a teacher training program to help her mother run a boarding house. Despite this inauspicious beginning, Bly became the best-known female journalist of her day, well-known for her daring undercover reportage (including, in addition to her time on Blackwell’s Island, stints in women’s jails and sweatshops). But the <i>World</i> was a sensationalist newspaper; although she was in her twenties, Nellie was described as “The New York World’s Girl Correspondent.” Rather than being presented as serious, wide-reaching exposes, her investigations were minimized as bold, showy stunts. “Fame does not increase the peculiar respect which men pay to female excellence,” wrote Nathanial Hawthorne in an 1830 diatribe against “ink-stained Amazons” like Bly. He believed there was “a sort of impropriety in the display of woman’s natal mind to the gaze of the world, with indications by which its inmost secrets may be searched out.”</p>

<p>Originally published as a series of illustrated articles in the World, <i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> is, stylistically, smooth and accessible—it can easily be finished in one sitting. Sometimes it’s even humorous, as when Nellie describes practicing her “crazy” expressions in front of a mirror. But things quickly turn dark.</p>

<p>Bly found it remarkably easy to convince authorities she was severely ill. She checked into a cheap women’s boarding house, where her fellow inhabitants had little motivation to accommodate a stranger’s crisis.  First, she acted in a paranoid fashion, accusing others of being out to murder her. Then, when she was taken to court to determine what should be done with her, she feigned amnesia. Most of the doctors who “examined” her declared her insane without serious consideration. One described her as “positively demented,” and another called her “a hopeless case.” After arriving at Blackwell’s Island, she stopped feigning madness, but it was too late—Nellie had already crossed the border into the shadowy world of the insane.</p>

<p>Disturbingly, she found many of the other female inmates to be as rational as herself. Many had been expelled to Blackwell’s Island for social, rather than psychological transgressions, such as not speaking English, having lovers, being weakened by labor or physical illness, or simply being alone in the world. It also became clear that many of the women who behaved as if they were  “insane” may well have been perfectly reasonable when first sent to the asylum, but had been driven mad by years spent in unspeakable torment. If Bly hadn’t had lawyers and supporters on the outside to secure her release, this could easily have been her fate, too.</p>

<p>Her ten days were torturous. Constant terrible cold, rats and cockroaches in the dormitories, scanty and inedible food, beatings and humiliation by the nurses. There was no “treatment” of any kind except forced cold baths in filthy water. Women were abused and punished for trying to get the attention of doctors when they visited the wards. “Dangerous cases” were tied together by ropes, like a chain gang. Worst of all, in Nellie’s experience, was the hell of sitting all day on stiff, backless benches, forbidden to move, with nothing to do—not even reading or sewing.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most devastating image she describes is that of women looking out through the asylum windows. “In the upper halls,” writes Bly, “a good view is obtained of the passing boats and New York.”  She imagines how it must feel to look at the lights “glimmering in the city,” knowing you had no one to obtain your release. All the women in the asylum once had families, she speculates. Surely they knew what it was like to be loved? Some of her fellow inmates delude themselves that there are people who care for them and will one day come and take them home. Others are able to face the truth—they have been forgotten.</p>

<p>In 1973, psychologist David Rosenhan undertook a “legitimate,” “scientific” version of Bly’s experiment by enlisting participants (including himself)  to feign insanity in order to get themselves admitted to various psychiatric institutions. Although details of Rosenhan’s study, “On Being Sane in Insane Places,” have since been questioned, it remains clear that, even a hundred years after Bly’s expose, the diagnosis of “insanity” is still wholly subjective. These parallel experiences suggest that anyone could face the fate of Bly's unit mates Tillie Mayard or Louise Schanz–"consigned to the asylum without a chance of making herself understood."</p>

<p>Perhaps more frightening is a related question: could any one of us become,  like the  asylum attendants in this book, someone who gets amusement from daily acts of cruelty to our fellow human beings? Bly spares no disdain for staff like Miss Grady and Miss Grupe, deploying her trademark withering humor to illustrate how the setting allows abuse to proliferate. The situation at Blackwell’s  has echoes in later examinations of how institutional roles shape such dynamics, such as the infamous 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment. Sadism is not a trait of perverse individuals, but situational, and common to humanity. </p>

<p>What makes life on Blackwell’s Island bearable is another common element of the human condition—women’s kindness. The inmates care for one another, share their food, sing to one another, tell each other stories, and—sometimes—even treat and heal each other. One of the most significant and moving elements of Bly’s story, even today, is her description of how she aligns herself with the women in the asylum. Even though she's arrived under false pretenses, she, like the others, knows what it's like to be a woman in a patriarchal society, and to be consistently disregarded, overlooked, and disbelieved.</p>

<p><i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> is essentially part of a tradition of women writing about their unnerving experiences in psychiatric institutions. More recent examples include Mary Jane Ward’s <i>The Snake Pit</i> (1946), Janet Frame’s <i>Faces in the Water </i>(1961),  Joanne Greenberg’s <i>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden</i> (1964), Bette Howland’s <i>W-3</i> (1974), and, best known of all, Sylvia Plath’s <i>The Bell Jar</i> (1961). One might argue that the later narratives are different from Bly’s in that their protagonist-narrators are institutionalized “legitimately,” due to incapacitating and sometimes dangerous experiences of mental illness. But each of these women is able to write eloquently and with great self-consciousness about their situations, although they are all, like Bly, writing after the fact of their release. (Writing in the hospital is generally considered unhealthy behavior, obsessive or even “pathological.”) This of course brings up the question central to all these books: what does it mean for a woman to be declared “insane”?</p>

<p>When first published in 1887, <i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> was promoted as “the book which forever changed the way the world looks at treatment and housing of the insane.” Much to Bly’s credit, the book did in fact lead to a grand-jury investigation of the asylum, and the granting of more funds to precipitate improvements in patient care. And yet shortly afterwards, Bly’s book, like the women on Blackwell’s Island, drifted beyond the borders of public consciousness, marginalized, forgotten, and alone. </p>

<p>Bly's account was written for a newspaper, to be read by the wider public rather than an audience versed in journalism or psychology. It is fitting, then, that this new edition is online and free for anyone to read, and taken out of the minimizing context of a "celebrity stunt." It is also appropriate that <i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> will appear in a catalog that includes  Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s "The Yellow Wallpaper," which enters into the interiority of a woman (albeit of a different class from those Bly meets in the asylum) suffering from extreme psychological illness. Situating the story in this new context allows a contemporary audience to finally understand and appreciate the radical and revelatory nature of Bly's experiment, and of the story she tells.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="chapter1">CHAPTER I.<br> <span class="large">A DELICATE MISSION.</span></h3>

On the 22d of September I was asked
by the <cite>World</cite> if I could have myself
committed to one of the asylums for
the insane in New York, with a view
to writing a plain and unvarnished
narrative of the treatment of the patients
therein and the methods of
management, etc. Did I think I
had the courage to go through such
an ordeal as the mission would demand?
Could I assume the characteristics
of insanity to such a degree that I could pass
the doctors, live for a week among the insane without
the authorities there finding out that I was only a “chiel
amang ’em takin’ notes?” I said I believed I could. I
had some faith in my own ability as an actress and
thought I could assume insanity long enough to accomplish
any mission intrusted to me. Could I pass a week
in the insane ward at Blackwell’s Island? I said I could
and I would. And I did.</p>

<p class="c010">My instructions were simply to go on with my work as
soon as I felt that I was ready. I was to chronicle faithfully
the experiences I underwent, and when once within
the walls of the asylum to find out and describe its inside
workings, which are always so effectually hidden by white-capped
nurses, as well as by bolts and bars, from the
knowledge of the public. “We do not ask you to go
there for the purpose of making sensational revelations.
Write up things as you find them, good or bad; give praise
or blame as you think best, and the truth all the time.
But I am afraid of that chronic smile of yours,” said the
editor. “I will smile no more,” I said, and I went away
to execute my delicate and, as I found out, difficult mission.</p>
<p class="c010">If I did get into the asylum, which I hardly hoped to
do, I had no idea that my experiences would contain
aught else than a simple tale of life in an asylum. That
such an institution could be mismanaged, and that cruelties
could exist ’neath its roof, I did not deem possible. I
always had a desire to know asylum life more thoroughly—a
desire to be convinced that the most helpless of God’s
creatures, the insane, were cared for kindly and properly.
The many stories I had read of abuses in such institutions
I had regarded as wildly exaggerated or else romances,
yet there was a latent desire to know positively.</p>
<p class="c010">I shuddered to think how completely the insane were
in the power of their keepers, and how one could weep
and plead for release, and all of no avail, if the keepers
were so minded. Eagerly I accepted the mission to learn
the inside workings of the Blackwell Island Insane
Asylum.</p>
<p class="c010">“How will you get me out,” I asked my editor, “after
I once get in?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not know,” he replied, “but we will get you out if
we have to tell who you are, and for what purpose you
feigned insanity—only get in.”</p>
<p class="c010">I had little belief in my ability to deceive the insanity
experts, and I think my editor had less.</p>
<p class="c010">All the preliminary preparations for my ordeal were left
to be planned by myself. Only one thing was decided
upon, namely, that I should pass under the pseudonym
of Nellie Brown, the initials of which would agree with
my own name and my linen, so that there would be no
difficulty in keeping track of my movements and assisting
me out of any difficulties or dangers I might get
into. There were ways of getting into the insane ward,
but I did not know them. I might adopt one of two
courses. Either I could feign insanity at the house of
friends, and get myself committed on the decision of
two competent physicians, or I could go to my goal by
way of the police courts.</p>

![nellie practices insanity at home](https://ucarecdn.com/e7c12747-4ff8-46ce-965c-ebc38a71e1ff/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-1.jpg "nellie practices insanity at home")

<p class="c010">On reflection I thought it wiser not to inflict myself
upon my friends or to get any good-natured doctors to
assist me in my purpose. Besides, to get to Blackwell’s
Island my friends would have had to feign poverty, and,
unfortunately for the end I had in view, my acquaintance
with the struggling poor, except my own self, was
only very superficial. So I determined upon the plan
which led me to the successful accomplishment of my
mission. I succeeded in getting committed to the insane
ward at Blackwell’s Island, where I spent ten days
and nights and had an experience which I shall never
forget. I took upon myself to enact the part of a poor,
unfortunate crazy girl, and felt it my duty not to shirk
any of the disagreeable results that should follow. I became
one of the city’s insane wards for that length of
time, experienced much, and saw and heard more of the
treatment accorded to this helpless class of our population,
and when I had seen and heard enough, my release
was promptly secured. I left the insane ward with pleasure
and regret—pleasure that I was once more able to
enjoy the free breath of heaven; regret that I could not
have brought with me some of the unfortunate women
who lived and suffered with me, and who, I am convinced,
are just as sane as I was and am now myself.</p>
<p class="c010">But here let me say one thing: From the moment I entered
the insane ward on the Island, I made no attempt
to keep up the assumed <i>role</i> of insanity. I talked and
acted just as I do in ordinary life. Yet strange to say,
the more sanely I talked and acted the crazier I was
thought to be by all except one physician, whose kindness
and gentle ways I shall not soon forget.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter2">CHAPTER II.<br> <span class="large">PREPARING FOR THE ORDEAL.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">But to return to my work and my mission. After receiving
my instructions I returned to my boarding-house,
and when evening came I began to practice the <i>role</i> in
which I was to make my <i>debut</i> on the morrow. What a
difficult task, I thought, to appear before a crowd of people
and convince them that I was insane. I had never
been near insane persons before in my life, and had not
the faintest idea of what their actions were like. And
then to be examined by a number of learned physicians
who make insanity a specialty, and who daily come in
contact with insane people! How could I hope to pass
these doctors and convince them that I was crazy? I
feared that they could not be deceived. I began to think
my task a hopeless one; but it had to be done. So I flew
to the mirror and examined my face. I remembered all
I had read of the doings of crazy people, how first of all
they must have staring eyes, and so I opened mine as wide
as possible and stared unblinkingly at my own reflection.
I assure you the sight was not reassuring, even to myself,
especially in the dead of night. I tried to turn the gas
up higher in hopes that it would raise my courage. I
succeeded only partially, but I consoled myself with the
thought that in a few nights more I would not be there,
but locked up in a cell with a lot of lunatics.</p>
<p class="c010">The weather was not cold; but, nevertheless, when I
thought of what was to come, wintery chills ran races up
and down my back in very mockery of the perspiration
which was slowly but surely taking the curl out of my
bangs. Between times, practicing before the mirror and
picturing my future as a lunatic, I read snatches of improbable
and impossible ghost stories, so that when the
dawn came to chase away the night, I felt that I was in
a fit mood for my mission, yet hungry enough to feel
keenly that I wanted my breakfast. Slowly and sadly I
took my morning bath and quietly bade farewell to a few
of the most precious articles known to modern civilization.
Tenderly I put my tooth-brush aside, and, when
taking a final rub of the soap, I murmured, “It may be
for days, and it may be—for longer.” Then I donned
the old clothing I had selected for the occasion. I was in
the mood to look at everything through very serious
glasses. It’s just as well to take a last “fond look,” I
mused, for who could tell but that the strain of playing
crazy, and being shut up with a crowd of mad people,
might turn my own brain, and I would never get back.
But not once did I think of shirking my mission.
Calmly, outwardly at least, I went out to my crazy business.</p>
<p class="c010">I first thought it best to go to a boarding-house, and,
after securing lodging, confidentially tell the landlady,
or lord, whichever it might chance to be, that I was seeking
work, and, in a few days after, apparently go insane.
When I reconsidered the idea, I feared it would take too
long to mature. Suddenly I thought how much easier it
would be to go to a boarding-home for working women.
I knew, if once I made a houseful of women believe me
crazy, that they would never rest until I was out of their
reach and in secure quarters.</p>
<p class="c010">From a directory I selected the Temporary Home for
Females, No. 84 Second Avenue. As I walked down the
avenue, I determined that, once inside the Home, I
should do the best I could to get started on my journey
to Blackwell’s Island and the Insane Asylum.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter3">CHAPTER III.<br> <span class="large">IN THE TEMPORARY HOME.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">I was left to begin my career as Nellie Brown, the insane
girl. As I walked down the avenue I tried to assume
the look which maidens wear in pictures entitled
“Dreaming.” “Far-away” expressions have a crazy air.
I passed through the little paved yard to the entrance of
the Home. I pulled the bell, which sounded loud enough
for a church chime, and nervously awaited the opening
of the door to the Home, which I intended should
ere long cast me forth and out upon the charity of the
police. The door was thrown back with a vengeance,
and a short, yellow-haired girl of some thirteen summers
stood before me.</p>
<p class="c010">“Is the matron in?” I asked, faintly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, she’s in; she’s busy. Go to the back parlor,”
answered the girl, in a loud voice, without one change in
her peculiarly matured face.</p>

<p class="c010">I followed these not overkind or polite instructions and
found myself in a dark, uncomfortable back-parlor.
There I awaited the arrival of my hostess. I had been
seated some twenty minutes at the least, when a slender
woman, clad in a plain, dark dress entered and, stopping
before me, ejaculated inquiringly, “Well?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Are you the matron?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” she replied, “the matron is sick; I am her
assistant. What do you want?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I want to stay here for a few days, if you can accommodate
me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I have no single rooms, we are so crowded; but
if you will occupy a room with another girl, I shall do
that much for you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I shall be glad of that,” I answered. “How much
do you charge?” I had brought only about seventy cents
along with me, knowing full well that the sooner my
funds were exhausted the sooner I should be put out, and
to be put out was what I was working for.</p>
<p class="c010">“We charge thirty cents a night,” was her reply to
my question, and with that I paid her for one night’s
lodging, and she left me on the plea of having something
else to look after. Left to amuse myself as best I
could, I took a survey of my surroundings.</p>
<p class="c010">They were not cheerful, to say the least. A wardrobe,
desk, book-case, organ, and several chairs completed the
furnishment of the room, into which the daylight barely
came.</p>
<p class="c010">By the time I had become familiar with my quarters a
bell, which rivaled the door-bell in its loudness, began
clanging in the basement, and simultaneously women
went trooping down-stairs from all parts of the house. I
imagined, from the obvious signs, that dinner was served,
but as no one had said anything to me I made no effort
to follow in the hungry train. Yet I did wish that some
one would invite me down. It always produces such a
lonely, homesick feeling to know others are eating, and
we haven’t a chance, even if we are not hungry. I was
glad when the assistant matron came up and asked me if
I did not want something to eat. I replied that I did,
and then I asked her what her name was. Mrs. Stanard,
she said, and I immediately wrote it down in a notebook
I had taken with me for the purpose of making memoranda,
and in which I had written several pages of utter
nonsense for inquisitive scientists.</p>
<p class="c010">Thus equipped I awaited developments. But my dinner—well,
I followed Mrs. Stanard down the uncarpeted
stairs into the basement, where a large number of women
were eating. She found room for me at a table with
three other women. The short-haired slavey who had
opened the door now put in an appearance as waiter.
Placing her arms akimbo and staring me out of countenance,
she said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Boiled mutton, boiled beef, beans, potatoes, coffee
or tea?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Beef, potatoes, coffee and bread,” I responded.</p>
<p class="c010">“Bread goes in,” she explained, as she made her way
to the kitchen, which was in the rear. It was not very
long before she returned with what I had ordered on a
large, badly battered tray, which she banged down before
me. I began my simple meal. It was not very enticing,
so while making a feint of eating I watched the
others.</p>
<p class="c010">I have often moralized on the repulsive form charity
always assumes! Here was a home for deserving women
and yet what a mockery the name was. The floor was
bare, and the little wooden tables were sublimely ignorant
of such modern beautifiers as varnish, polish and table-covers.
It is useless to talk about the cheapness of linen
and its effect on civilization. Yet these honest workers,
the most deserving of women, are asked to call this spot
of bareness—home.</p>
<p class="c010">When the meal was finished each woman went to the
desk in the corner, where Mrs. Stanard sat, and paid her
bill. I was given a much-used, and abused, red check,
by the original piece of humanity in shape of my waitress.
My bill was about thirty cents.</p>
<p class="c010">After dinner I went up-stairs and resumed my former
place in the back parlor. I was quite cold and uncomfortable,
and had fully made up my mind that I could
not endure that sort of business long, so the sooner I
assumed my insane points the sooner I would be released
from enforced idleness. Ah! that was indeed the longest
day I had ever lived. I listlessly watched the women
in the front parlor, where all sat except myself.</p>
<p class="c010">One did nothing but read and scratch her head and
occasionally call out mildly, “Georgie,” without lifting
her eyes from her book. “Georgie” was her over-frisky
boy, who had more noise in him than any child I ever
saw before. He did everything that was rude and unmannerly,
I thought, and the mother never said a word
unless she heard some one else yell at him. Another
woman always kept going to sleep and waking herself up
with her own snoring. I really felt wickedly thankful it
was only herself she awakened. The majority of the
women sat there doing nothing, but there were a few who
made lace and knitted unceasingly. The enormous door-bell
seemed to be going all the time, and so did the short-haired
girl. The latter was, besides, one of those girls
who sing all the time snatches of all the songs and
hymns that have been composed for the last fifty years.
There is such a thing as martyrdom in these days. The
ringing of the bell brought more people who wanted
shelter for the night. Excepting one woman, who was
from the country on a day’s shopping expedition, they
were working women, some of them with children.</p>
<p class="c010">As it drew toward evening Mrs. Stanard came to me
and said:</p>
<p class="c010">“What is wrong with you? Have you some sorrow or
trouble?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” I said, almost stunned at the suggestion.
“Why?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, because,” she said, womanlike, “I can see it in
your face. It tells the story of a great trouble.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, everything is so sad,” I said, in a haphazard
way, which I had intended to reflect my craziness.</p>
<p class="c010">“But you must not allow that to worry you. We all
have our troubles, but we get over them in good time.
What kind of work are you trying to get?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not know; it’s all so sad,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Would you like to be a nurse for children and wear a
nice white cap and apron?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">I put my handkerchief up to my face to hide a smile,
and replied, in a muffled tone, “I never worked; I don’t
know how.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you must learn,” she urged; “all these women
here work.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do they?” I said, in a low, thrilling whisper. “Why,
they look horrible to me; just like crazy women. I am
so afraid of them.”</p>
<p class="c010">“They don’t look very nice,” she answered, assentingly,
“but they are good, honest working women. We do not
keep crazy people here.”</p>
<p class="c010">I again used my handkerchief to hide a smile, as I
thought that before morning she would at least think she
had one crazy person among her flock.</p>
<p class="c010">“They all look crazy,” I asserted again, “and I am
afraid of them. There are so many crazy people about,
and one can never tell what they will do. Then there
are so many murders committed, and the police never
catch the murderers,” and I finished with a sob that
would have broken up an audience of <i>blase</i> critics. She
gave a sudden and convulsive start, and I knew my first
stroke had gone home. It was amusing to see what a remarkably
short time it took her to get up from her chair
and to whisper hurriedly: “I’ll come back to talk with
you after awhile.” I knew she would not come back and
she did not.</p>
<p class="c010">When the supper-bell rang I went along with the
others to the basement and partook of the evening meal,
which was similar to dinner, except that there was a
smaller bill of fare and more people, the women who are
employed outside during the day having returned. After
the evening meal we all adjourned to the parlors, where
all sat, or stood, as there were not chairs enough to
go round.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a wretchedly lonely evening, and the light
which fell from the solitary gas jet in the parlor, and oil-lamp
in the hall, helped to envelop us in a dusky hue
and dye our spirits a navy blue, I felt it would not require
many inundations of this atmosphere to make me
a fit subject for the place I was striving to reach.</p>

<p class="c010">I watched two women, who seemed of all the crowd to
be the most sociable, and I selected them as the ones to
work out my salvation, or, more properly speaking, my
condemnation and conviction. Excusing myself and saying
that I felt lonely, I asked if I might join their company.
They graciously consented, so with my hat and
gloves on, which no one had asked me to lay aside, I sat
down and listened to the rather wearisome conversation,
in which I took no part, merely keeping up my sad look,
saying “Yes,” or “No,” or “I can’t say,” to their observations.
Several times I told them I thought everybody
in the house looked crazy, but they were slow to
catch on to my very original remark. One said her name
was Mrs. King and that she was a Southern woman. Then
she said that I had a Southern accent. She asked me
bluntly if I did not really come from the South. I said
“Yes.” The other woman got to talking about the Boston
boats and asked me if I knew at what time they
left.</p>
<p class="c010">For a moment I forgot my <i>role</i> of assumed insanity,
and told her the correct hour of departure. She then
asked me what work I was going to do, or if I had ever
done any. I replied that I thought it very sad that
there were so many working people in the world. She
said in reply that she had been unfortunate and had
come to New York, where she had worked at correcting
proofs on a medical dictionary for some time, but that
her health had given way under the task, and that she
was now going to Boston again. When the maid came
to tell us to go to bed I remarked that I was afraid, and
again ventured the assertion that all the women in the
house seemed to be crazy. The nurse insisted on my
going to bed. I asked if I could not sit on the stairs,
but she said, decisively: “No; for every one in the
house would think you were crazy.” Finally I allowed
them to take me to a room.</p>
<p class="c010">Here I must introduce a new personage by name into
my narrative. It is the woman who had been a proofreader,
and was about to return to Boston. She was a
Mrs. Caine, who was as courageous as she was good-hearted.
She came into my room, and sat and talked
with me a long time, taking down my hair with gentle
ways. She tried to persuade me to undress and go to
bed, but I stubbornly refused to do so. During this time
a number of the inmates of the house had gathered
around us. They expressed themselves in various ways.
“Poor loon!” they said. “Why, she’s crazy enough!”
“I am afraid to stay with such a crazy being in the
house.” “She will murder us all before morning.”
One woman was for sending for a policeman to take me
away at once. They were all in a terrible and real state
of fright.</p>
<p class="c010">No one wanted to be responsible for me, and the
woman who was to occupy the room with me declared
that she would not stay with that “crazy woman” for
all the money of the Vanderbilts. It was then that Mrs.
Caine said she would stay with me. I told her I would
like to have her do so. So she was left with me. She
didn’t undress, but lay down on the bed, watchful of my
movements. She tried to induce me to lie down, but I
was afraid to do this. I knew that if I once gave way I
should fall asleep and dream as pleasantly and peacefully
as a child. I should, to use a slang expression, be liable to
“give myself dead away.” I had made up my mind to stay
awake all night. So I insisted on sitting on the side of
the bed and staring blankly at vacancy. My poor companion
was put into a wretched state of unhappiness.
Every few moments she would rise up to look at me.
She told me that my eyes shone terribly brightly and
then began to question me, asking me where I had lived,
how long I had been in New York, what I had been
doing, and many things besides. To all her questionings
I had but one response—I told her that I had
forgotten everything, that ever since my headache had
come on I could not remember.</p>
<p class="c010">Poor soul! How cruelly I tortured her, and what a
kind heart she had! But how I tortured all of them!
One of them dreamed of me—as a nightmare. After I
had been in the room an hour or so, I was myself startled
by hearing a woman screaming in the next room. I
began to imagine that I was really in an insane asylum.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Caine woke up, looked around, frightened, and
listened. She then went out and into the next room,
and I heard her asking another woman some questions.
When she came back she told me that the woman had
had a hideous nightmare. She had been dreaming of
me. She had seen me, she said, rushing at her with a
knife in my hand, with the intention of killing her. In
trying to escape me she had fortunately been able to
scream, and so to awaken herself and scare off her nightmare.
Then Mrs. Caine got into bed again, considerably
agitated, but very sleepy.</p>
I was weary, too, but I had braced myself up to the
work, and was determined to keep awake all night so as
to carry on my work of impersonation to a successful end
in the morning. I heard midnight. I had yet six hours
to wait for daylight. The time passed with excruciating
slowness. Minutes appeared hours. The noises in the
house and on the avenue ceased.</p>
<p class="c010">Fearing that sleep would coax me into its grasp, I commenced
to review my life. How strange it all seems! One
incident, if never so trifling, is but a link more to chain
us to our unchangeable fate. I began at the beginning,
and lived again the story of my life. Old friends were recalled
with a pleasurable thrill; old enmities, old heartaches,
old joys were once again present. The turned-down
pages of my life were turned up, and the past was
present.</p>
<p class="c010">When it was completed, I turned my thoughts bravely
to the future, wondering, first, what the next day would
bring forth, then making plans for the carrying out of
my project. I wondered if I should be able to pass over
the river to the goal of my strange ambition, to become
eventually an inmate of the halls inhabited by my mentally
wrecked sisters. And then, once in, what would be
my experience? And after? How to get out? Bah! I
said, they will get me out.</p>
<p class="c010">That was the greatest night of my existence. For a
few hours I stood face to face with “self!”</p>
<p class="c010">I looked out toward the window and hailed with joy
the slight shimmer of dawn. The light grew strong and
gray, but the silence was strikingly still. My companion
slept. I had still an hour or two to pass over. Fortunately
I found some employment for my mental activity.
Robert Bruce in his captivity had won confidence in the
future, and passed his time as pleasantly as possible
under the circumstances, by watching the celebrated
spider building his web. I had less noble vermin to interest
me. Yet I believe I made some valuable discoveries
in natural history. I was about dropping off to sleep
in spite of myself when I was suddenly startled to wakefulness.
I thought I heard something crawl and fall
down upon the counterpane with an almost inaudible
thud.</p>
<p class="c010">I had the opportunity of studying these interesting
animals very thoroughly. They had evidently come for
breakfast, and were not a little disappointed to find that
their principal <i>plat</i> was not there. They scampered up
and down the pillow, came together, seemed to hold interesting
converse, and acted in every way as if they were
puzzled by the absence of an appetizing breakfast. After
one consultation of some length they finally disappeared,
seeking victims elsewhere, and leaving me to pass the
long minutes by giving my attention to cockroaches,
whose size and agility were something of a surprise to
me.</p>
<p class="c010">My room companion had been sound asleep for a long
time, but she now woke up, and expressed surprise at seeing
me still awake and apparently as lively as a cricket.
She was as sympathetic as ever. She came to me and
took my hands and tried her best to console me, and asked
me if I did not want to go home. She kept me up-stairs
until nearly everybody was out of the house, and then
took me down to the basement for coffee and a bun.
After that, partaken in silence, I went back to my room,
where I sat down, moping. Mrs. Caine grew more and
more anxious. “What is to be done?” she kept exclaiming.
“Where are your friends?” “No,” I answered,
“I have no friends, but I have some trunks. Where are
they? I want them.” The good woman tried to pacify
me, saying that they would be found in good time. She
believed that I was insane.</p>
<p class="c010">Yet I forgive her. It is only after one is in trouble
that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there
is in the world. The women in the Home who were
not afraid of me had wanted to have some amusement at
my expense, and so they had bothered me with questions
and remarks that had I been insane would have been
cruel and inhumane. Only this one woman among the
crowd, pretty and delicate Mrs. Caine, displayed true
womanly feeling. She compelled the others to cease
teasing me and took the bed of the woman who refused
to sleep near me. She protested against the suggestion
to leave me alone and to have me locked up for the night
so that I could harm no one. She insisted on remaining
with me in order to administer aid should I need it.
She smoothed my hair and bathed my brow and talked as
soothingly to me as a mother would do to an ailing child.
By every means she tried to have me go to bed and rest,
and when it drew toward morning she got up and
wrapped a blanket around me for fear I might get
cold; then she kissed me on the brow and whispered,
compassionately:</p>
<p class="c010">“Poor child, poor child!”</p>
<p class="c010">How much I admired that little woman’s courage and
kindness. How I longed to reassure her and whisper
that I was not insane, and how I hoped that, if any poor
girl should ever be so unfortunate as to be what I was
pretending to be, she might meet with one who possessed
the same spirit of human kindness possessed by Mrs.
Ruth Caine.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter4">CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class="large">JUDGE DUFFY AND THE POLICE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">But to return to my story. I kept up my <i>role</i> until
the assistant matron, Mrs. Stanard, came in. She tried
to persuade me to be calm. I began to see clearly that
she wanted to get me out of the house at all hazards,
quietly if possible. This I did not want. I refused to
move, but kept up ever the refrain of my lost trunks.
Finally some one suggested that an officer be sent for.
After awhile Mrs. Stanard put on her bonnet and went
out. Then I knew that I was making an advance toward
the home of the insane. Soon she returned, bringing
with her two policemen—big, strong men—who entered
the room rather unceremoniously, evidently expecting to
meet with a person violently crazy. The name of one of
them was Tom Bockert.</p>
<p class="c010">When they entered I pretended not to see them. “I
want you to take her quietly,” said Mrs. Stanard. “If
she don’t come along quietly,” responded one of the men,
“I will drag her through the streets.” I still took no
notice of them, but certainly wished to avoid raising a
scandal outside. Fortunately Mrs. Caine came to my
rescue. She told the officers about my outcries for my
lost trunks, and together they made up a plan to get me
to go along with them quietly by telling me they would
go with me to look for my lost effects. They asked me
if I would go. I said I was afraid to go alone. Mrs.
Stanard then said she would accompany me, and she arranged
that the two policemen should follow us at a respectful
distance. She tied on my veil for me, and we
left the house by the basement and started across town,
the two officers following at some distance behind. We
walked along very quietly and finally came to the station-house,
which the good woman assured me was the express
office, and that there we should certainly find my
missing effects. I went inside with fear and trembling,
for good reason.</p>
<p class="c010">A few days previous to this I had met Captain McCullagh
at a meeting held in Cooper Union. At that time
I had asked him for some information which he had
given me. If he were in, would he not recognize me?
And then all would be lost so far as getting to the island
was concerned. I pulled my sailor hat as low down over
my face as I possibly could, and prepared for the ordeal.
Sure enough there was sturdy Captain McCullagh standing
near the desk.</p>
<p class="c010">He watched me closely as the officer at the desk conversed
in a low tone with Mrs. Stanard and the policeman
who brought me.</p>
<p class="c010">“Are you Nellie Brown?” asked the officer. I said I
supposed I was. “Where do you come from?” he asked.
I told him I did not know, and then Mrs. Stanard gave
him a lot of information about me—told him how
strangely I had acted at her home; how I had not slept a
wink all night, and that in her opinion I was a poor unfortunate
who had been driven crazy by inhuman treatment.
There was some discussion between Mrs. Stanard
and the two officers, and Tom Bockert was told to take
us down to the court in a car.</p>

![In the Hands of the Police](https://ucarecdn.com/1dfad8ff-8b5a-4b7b-baf8-aef69b26417e/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-4.jpg "In the Hands of the Police")

<p class="c010">“Come along,” Bockert said, “I will find your trunk
for you.” We all went together, Mrs. Stanard, Tom
Bockert, and myself. I said it was very kind of them to
go with me, and I should not soon forget them. As we
walked along I kept up my refrain about my trunks, interjecting
occasionally some remark about the dirty condition
of the streets and the curious character of the people
we met on the way. “I don’t think I have ever seen
such people before,” I said. “Who are they?” I asked,
and my companions looked upon me with expressions of
pity, evidently believing I was a foreigner, an immigrant
or something of the sort. They told me that the people
around me were working people. I remarked once more
that I thought there were too many working people in
the world for the amount of work to be done, at which remark
Policeman P. T. Bockert eyed me closely, evidently
thinking that my mind was gone for good. We passed
several other policemen, who generally asked my sturdy
guardians what was the matter with me. By this time
quite a number of ragged children were following us too,
and they passed remarks about me that were to me
original as well as amusing.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s she up for?” “Say, kop, where did ye get
her?” “Where did yer pull ’er?” “She’s a daisy!”</p>
<p class="c010">Poor Mrs. Stanard was more frightened than I was.
The whole situation grew interesting, but I still had
fears for my fate before the judge.</p>
<p class="c010">At last we came to a low building, and Tom Bockert
kindly volunteered the information: “Here’s the express
office. We shall soon find those trunks of yours.”</p>
<p class="c010">The entrance to the building was surrounded by a
curious crowd and I did not think my case was bad enough
to permit me passing them without some remark, so I asked
if all those people had lost their trunks.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” he said, “nearly all these people are looking
for trunks.”</p>
<p class="c010">I said, “They all seem to be foreigners, too.” “Yes,”
said Tom, “they are all foreigners just landed. They
have all lost their trunks, and it takes most of our time
to help find them for them.”</p>
<p class="c010">We entered the courtroom. It was the Essex Market
Police Courtroom. At last the question of my sanity or
insanity was to be decided. Judge Duffy sat behind the
high desk, wearing a look which seemed to indicate that
he was dealing out the milk of human kindness by wholesale.
I rather feared I would not get the fate I sought,
because of the kindness I saw on every line of his face,
and it was with rather a sinking heart that I followed
Mrs. Stanard as she answered the summons to go up to
the desk, where Tom Bockert had just given an account
of the affair.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come here,” said an officer. “What is your name?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown,” I replied, with a little accent. “I
have lost my trunks, and would like if you could find
them.”</p>
<p class="c010">“When did you come to New York?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“I did not come to New York,” I replied (while I
added, mentally, “because I have been here for some
time.”)</p>
<p class="c010">“But you are in New York now,” said the man.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” I said, looking as incredulous as I thought a
crazy person could, “I did not come to New York.”</p>
<p class="c010">“That girl is from the west,” he said, in a tone that
made me tremble. “She has a western accent.”</p>
<p class="c010">Some one else who had been listening to the brief dialogue
here asserted that he had lived south and that my
accent was southern, while another officer was positive it
was eastern. I felt much relieved when the first spokesman
turned to the judge and said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Judge, here is a peculiar case of a young woman who
doesn’t know who she is or where she came from. You
had better attend to it at once.”</p>
<p class="c010">I commenced to shake with more than the cold, and I
looked around at the strange crowd about me, composed
of poorly dressed men and women with stories printed on
their faces of hard lives, abuse and poverty. Some were
consulting eagerly with friends, while others sat still with
a look of utter hopelessness. Everywhere was a sprinkling
of well-dressed, well-fed officers watching the scene
passively and almost indifferently. It was only an old
story with them. One more unfortunate added to a long
list which had long since ceased to be of any interest or
concern to them.</p>

![Nellie Before Judge Duffy](https://ucarecdn.com/6ed65480-0b1c-4213-a4cb-4a8b8759dfca/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-3.jpg "Nellie Before Judge Duffy")

<p class="c010">“Come here, girl, and lift your veil,” called out Judge
Duffy, in tones which surprised me by a harshness which
I did not think from the kindly face he possessed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Who are you speaking to?” I inquired, in my stateliest
manner.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come here, my dear, and lift your veil. You know
the Queen of England, if she were here, would have to
lift her veil,” he said, very kindly.</p>
<p class="c010">“That is much better,” I replied. “I am not the
Queen of England, but I’ll lift my veil.”</p>
<p class="c010">As I did so the little judge looked at me, and then, in
a very kind and gentle tone, he said:</p>
<p class="c010">“My dear child, what is wrong?”</p>
“Nothing is wrong except that I have lost my trunks,
and this man,” indicating Policeman Bockert, “promised
to bring me where they could be found.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What do you know about this child?” asked the
judge, sternly, of Mrs. Stanard, who stood, pale and
trembling, by my side.</p>
<p class="c010">“I know nothing of her except that she came to the
home yesterday and asked to remain overnight.”</p>
<p class="c010">“The home! What do you mean by the home?” asked
Judge Duffy, quickly.</p>
<p class="c010">“It is a temporary home kept for working women at
No. 84 Second Avenue.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What is your position there?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I am assistant matron.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, tell us all you know of the case.”</p>
<p class="c010">“When I was going into the home yesterday I noticed
her coming down the avenue. She was all alone. I had
just got into the house when the bell rang and she came
in. When I talked with her she wanted to know if she
could stay all night, and I said she could. After awhile
she said all the people in the house looked crazy, and
she was afraid of them. Then she would not go to bed,
but sat up all the night.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Had she any money?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” I replied, answering for her, “I paid her for
everything, and the eating was the worst I ever tried.”</p>
<p class="c010">There was a general smile at this, and some murmurs
of “She’s not so crazy on the food question.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Poor child,” said Judge Duffy, “she is well dressed,
and a lady. Her English is perfect, and I would stake
everything on her being a good girl. I am positive she
is somebody’s darling.”</p>
<p class="c010">At this announcement everybody laughed, and I put
my handkerchief over my face and endeavored to choke
the laughter that threatened to spoil my plans, in despite
of my resolutions.</p>
<p class="c010">“I mean she is some woman’s darling,” hastily amended
the judge. “I am sure some one is searching for her.
Poor girl, I will be good to her, for she looks like my
sister, who is dead.”</p>
<p class="c010">There was a hush for a moment after this announcement,
and the officers glanced at me more kindly, while
I silently blessed the kind-hearted judge, and hoped that
any poor creatures who might be afflicted as I pretended
to be should have as kindly a man to deal with as Judge
Duffy.</p>
<p class="c010">“I wish the reporters were here,” he said at last.
“They would be able to find out something about her.”</p>
<p class="c010">I got very much frightened at this, for if there is any
one who can ferret out a mystery it is a reporter. I felt
that I would rather face a mass of expert doctors, policemen,
and detectives than two bright specimens of my
craft, so I said:</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t see why all this is needed to help me find my
trunks. These men are impudent, and I do not want to
be stared at. I will go away. I don’t want to stay here.”</p>
<p class="c010">So saying, I pulled down my veil and secretly hoped
the reporters would be detained elsewhere until I was
sent to the asylum.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know what to do with the poor child,” said
the worried judge. “She must be taken care of.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Send her to the Island,” suggested one of the officers.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, don’t!” said Mrs. Stanard, in evident alarm.
“Don’t! She is a lady and it would kill her to be put on
the Island.”</p>
<p class="c010">For once I felt like shaking that good woman. To
think the Island was just the place I wanted to reach and
here she was trying to keep me from going there! It
was very kind of her, but rather provoking under the
circumstances.</p>
<p class="c010">“There has been some foul work here,” said the judge.
“I believe this child has been drugged and brought to
this city. Make out the papers and we will send her to
Bellevue for examination. Probably in a few days the
effect of the drug will pass off and she will be able to tell
us a story that will be startling. If the reporters would
only come!”</p>
<p class="c010">I dreaded them, so I said something about not wishing
to stay there any longer to be gazed at. Judge Duffy
then told Policeman Bockert to take me to the back
office. After we were seated there Judge Duffy came in
and asked me if my home was in Cuba.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” I replied, with a smile. “How did you
know?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I knew it, my dear. Now, tell me where was it?
In what part of Cuba?”</p>
<p class="c010">“On the hacienda,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah,” said the judge, “on a farm. Do you remember
Havana?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Si, senor,” I answered; “it is near home. How did
you know?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I knew all about it. Now, won’t you tell me the
name of your home?” he asked, persuasively.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s what I forget,” I answered, sadly. “I have
a headache all the time, and it makes me forget things.
I don’t want them to trouble me. Everybody is asking
me questions, and it makes my head worse,” and in truth
it did.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, no one shall trouble you any more. Sit down
here and rest awhile,” and the genial judge left me alone
with Mrs. Stanard.</p>
<p class="c010">Just then an officer came in with a reporter. I was so
frightened, and thought I would be recognized as a journalist,
so I turned my head away and said, “I don’t want
to see any reporters; I will not see any; the judge said I
was not to be troubled.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, there is no insanity in that,” said the man who
had brought the reporter, and together they left the room.
Once again I had a fit of fear. Had I gone too far in not
wanting to see a reporter, and was my sanity detected?
If I had given the impression that I was sane, I was determined
to undo it, so I jumped up and ran back and
forward through the office, Mrs. Stanard clinging terrified
to my arm.</p>
<p class="c010">“I won’t stay here; I want my trunks! Why do they
bother me with so many people?” and thus I kept on until
the ambulance surgeon came in, accompanied by the
judge.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter5">CHAPTER V.<br> <span class="large">PRONOUNCED INSANE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">“Here is a poor girl who has been drugged,” explained
the judge. “She looks like my sister, and any
one can see she is a good girl. I am interested in the
child, and I would do as much for her as if she were my
own. I want you to be kind to her,” he said to the ambulance
surgeon. Then, turning to Mrs. Stanard, he
asked her if she could not keep me for a few days until
my case was inquired into. Fortunately, she said she
could not, because all the women at the Home were
afraid of me, and would leave if I were kept there. I
was very much afraid she would keep me if the pay was
assured her, and so I said something about the bad cooking
and that I did not intend to go back to the Home.
Then came the examination; the doctor looked clever
and I had not one hope of deceiving him, but I determined
to keep up the farce.</p>
<p class="c010">“Put out your tongue,” he ordered, briskly.</p>
<p class="c010">I gave an inward chuckle at the thought.</p>
<p class="c010">“Put out your tongue when I tell you,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t want to,” I answered, truthfully enough.</p>
<p class="c010">“You must. You are sick, and I am a doctor.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I am not sick and never was. I only want my
trunks.”</p>
<p class="c010">But I put out my tongue, which he looked at in a
sagacious manner. Then he felt my pulse and listened
to the beating of my heart. I had not the least idea how
the heart of an insane person beat, so I held my breath
all the while he listened, until, when he quit, I had to
give a gasp to regain it. Then he tried the effect of the
light on the pupils of my eyes. Holding his hand within
a half inch of my face, he told me to look at it, then,
jerking it hastily away, he would examine my eyes. I
was puzzled to know what insanity was like in the eye, so
I thought the best thing under the circumstances was to
stare. This I did. I held my eyes riveted unblinkingly
upon his hand, and when he removed it I exerted all my
strength to still keep my eyes from blinking.</p>

<p class="c010">“What drugs have you been taking?” he then asked
me.</p>
<p class="c010">“Drugs!” I repeated, wonderingly. “I do not know
what drugs are.”</p>
<p class="c010">“The pupils of her eyes have been enlarged ever since
she came to the Home. They have not changed once,”
explained Mrs. Stanard. I wondered how she knew
whether they had or not, but I kept quiet.</p>
<p class="c010">“I believe she has been using belladonna,” said the
doctor, and for the first time I was thankful that I was a
little near-sighted, which of course answers for the enlargement
of the pupils. I thought I might as well be
truthful when I could without injuring my case, so I told
him I was near-sighted, that I was not in the least ill,
had never been sick, and that no one had a right to
detain me when I wanted to find my trunks. I wanted
to go home. He wrote a lot of things in a long, slender
book, and then said he was going to take me home. The
judge told him to take me and to be kind to me, and to
tell the people at the hospital to be kind to me, and to do
all they could for me. If we only had more such men as
Judge Duffy, the poor unfortunates would not find life all
darkness.</p>
<p class="c010">I began to have more confidence in my own ability
now, since one judge, one doctor, and a mass of people
had pronounced me insane, and I put on my veil quite
gladly when I was told that I was to be taken in a carriage,
and that afterward I could go home. “I am so
glad to go with you,” I said, and I meant it. I was very
glad indeed. Once more, guarded by Policeman Brockert,
I walked through the little, crowded courtroom. I
felt quite proud of myself as I went out a side door into
an alleyway, where the ambulance was waiting. Near the
closed and barred gates was a small office occupied by
several men and large books. We all went in there, and
when they began to ask me questions the doctor interposed
and said he had all the papers, and that it was
useless to ask me anything further, because I was unable
to answer questions. This was a great relief to me, for
my nerves were already feeling the strain. A rough-looking
man wanted to put me into the ambulance, but I
refused his aid so decidedly that the doctor and policeman
told him to desist, and they performed that gallant
office themselves. I did not enter the ambulance without
protest. I made the remark that I had never seen a
carriage of that make before, and that I did not want to
ride in it, but after awhile I let them persuade me, as I
had right along intended to do.</p>
<p class="c010">I shall never forget that ride. After I was put in flat
on the yellow blanket, the doctor got in and sat near the
door. The large gates were swung open, and the curious
crowd which had collected swayed back to make way
for the ambulance as it backed out. How they tried to
get a glimpse at the supposed crazy girl! The doctor
saw that I did not like the people gazing at me, and considerately
put down the curtains, after asking my wishes
in regard to it. Still that did not keep the people away.
The children raced after us, yelling all sorts of slang expressions,
and trying to get a peep under the curtains.
It was quite an interesting drive, but I must say that it
was an excruciatingly rough one. I held on, only there
was not much to hold on to, and the driver drove as if he
feared some one would catch up with us.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter6">CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class="large">IN BELLEVUE HOSPITAL.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">At last Bellevue was reached, the third station on my
way to the island. I had passed through successfully the
ordeals at the home and at Essex Market Police Court,
and now felt confident that I should not fail. The ambulance
stopped with a sudden jerk and the doctor
jumped out. “How many have you?” I heard some one
inquire. “Only one, for the pavilion,” was the reply.
A rough-looking man came forward, and catching hold
of me attempted to drag me out as if I had the strength
of an elephant and would resist. The doctor, seeing my
look of disgust, ordered him to leave me alone, saying
that he would take charge of me himself. He then lifted
me carefully out and I walked with the grace of a queen
past the crowd that had gathered curious to see the new
unfortunate. Together with the doctor I entered a small
dark office, where there were several men. The one behind
the desk opened a book and began on the long string
of questions which had been asked me so often.</p>
<p class="c010">I refused to answer, and the doctor told him it was not
necessary to trouble me further, as he had all the papers
made out, and I was too insane to be able to tell anything
that would be of consequence. I felt relieved that
it was so easy here, as, though still undaunted, I had
begun to feel faint for want of food. The order was then
given to take me to the insane pavilion, and a muscular
man came forward and caught me so tightly by the arm
that a pain ran clear through me. It made me angry,
and for a moment I forgot my <i>role</i> as I turned to him
and said:</p>
<p class="c010">“How dare you touch me?” At this he loosened his
hold somewhat, and I shook him off with more strength
than I thought I possessed.</p>
<p class="c010">“I will go with no one but this man,” I said, pointing
to the ambulance-surgeon. “The judge said that he
was to take care of me, and I will go with no one else.”</p>
<p class="c010">At this the surgeon said that he would take me, and so
we went arm in arm, following the man who had at first
been so rough with me. We passed through the well-cared-for
grounds and finally reached the insane ward.
A white-capped nurse was there to receive me.</p>
<p class="c010">“This young girl is to wait here for the boat,” said the
surgeon, and then he started to leave me. I begged him
not to go, or to take me with him, but he said he wanted
to get his dinner first, and that I should wait there for
him. When I insisted on accompanying him he claimed
that he had to assist at an amputation, and it would not
look well for me to be present. It was evident that he
believed he was dealing with an insane person. Just
then the most horrible insane cries came from a yard in
the rear. With all my bravery I felt a chill at the prospect
of being shut up with a fellow-creature who was
really insane. The doctor evidently noticed my nervousness,
for he said to the attendant:</p>
<p class="c010">“What a noise the carpenters make.”</p>
<p class="c010">Turning to me he offered me explanation to the effect
that new buildings were being erected, and that the noise
came from some of the workmen engaged upon it. I
told him I did not want to stay there without him, and
to pacify me he promised soon to return. He left me
and I found myself at last an occupant of an insane
asylum.</p>
<p class="c010">I stood at the door and contemplated the scene before
me. The long, uncarpeted hall was scrubbed to that
peculiar whiteness seen only in public institutions. In
the rear of the hall were large iron doors fastened by a
padlock. Several stiff-looking benches and a number of
willow chairs were the only articles of furniture. On
either side of the hall were doors leading into what I
supposed and what proved to be bedrooms. Near the
entrance door, on the right-hand side, was a small sitting-room
for the nurses, and opposite it was a room where
dinner was dished out. A nurse in a black dress, white
cap and apron and armed with a bunch of keys had
charge of the hall. I soon learned her name, Miss Ball.</p>
<p class="c010">An old Irishwoman was maid-of-all-work. I heard her
called Mary, and I am glad to know that there is such a
good-hearted woman in that place. I experienced only
kindness and the utmost consideration from her. There
were only three patients, as they are called. I made the
fourth. I thought I might as well begin work at once,
for I still expected that the very first doctor might declare
me sane and send me out again into the wide, wide
world. So I went down to the rear of the room and introduced
myself to one of the women, and asked her all
about herself. Her name, she said, was Miss Anne
Neville, and she had been sick from overwork. She had
been working as a chambermaid, and when her health
gave way she was sent to some Sisters’ Home to be
treated. Her nephew, who was a waiter, was out of
work, and, being unable to pay her expenses at the Home,
had had her transferred to Bellevue.</p>
<p class="c010">“Is there anything wrong with you mentally as well?”
I asked her.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” she said. “The doctors have been asking me
many curious questions and confusing me as much as
possible, but I have nothing wrong with my brain.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you know that only insane people are sent to this
pavilion?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, I know; but I am unable to do anything. The
doctors refuse to listen to me, and it is useless to say anything
to the nurses.”</p>
<p class="c010">Satisfied from various reasons that Miss Neville was as
sane as I was myself, I transferred my attentions to one of
the other patients. I found her in need of medical aid
and quite silly mentally, although I have seen many
women in the lower walks of life, whose sanity was never
questioned, who were not any brighter.</p>
<p class="c010">The third patient, Mrs. Fox, would not say much.
She was very quiet, and after telling me that her case
was hopeless refused to talk. I began now to feel surer
of my position, and I determined that no doctor should
convince me that I was sane so long as I had the hope of
accomplishing my mission. A small, fair-complexioned
nurse arrived, and, after putting on her cap, told Miss
Ball to go to dinner. The new nurse, Miss Scott by
name, came to me and said, rudely:</p>
<p class="c010">“Take off your hat.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I shall not take off my hat,” I answered. “I am
waiting for the boat, and I shall not remove it.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, you are not going on any boat. You might as
well know it now as later. You are in an asylum for the
insane.”</p>
<p class="c010">Although fully aware of that fact, her unvarnished
words gave me a shock. “I did not want to come here;
I am not sick or insane, and I will not stay,” I said.</p>
<p class="c010">“It will be a long time before you get out if you don’t
do as you are told,” answered Miss Scott. “You might
as well take off your hat, or I shall use force, and if I
am not able to do it, I have but to touch a bell and I
shall get assistance. Will you take it off?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, I will not. I am cold, and I want my hat on,
and you can’t make me take it off.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I shall give you a few more minutes, and if you don’t
take it off then I shall use force, and I warn you it will
not be very gentle.”</p>
<p class="c010">“If you take my hat off I shall take your cap off; so
now.”</p>
<p class="c010">Miss Scott was called to the door then, and as I feared
that an exhibition of temper might show too much sanity
I took off my hat and gloves and was sitting quietly
looking into space when she returned. I was hungry,
and was quite pleased to see Mary make preparations for
dinner. The preparations were simple. She merely
pulled a straight bench up along the side of a bare table
and ordered the patients to gather ’round the feast;
then she brought out a small tin plate on which was a
piece of boiled meat and a potato. It could not have
been colder had it been cooked the week before, and it
had no chance to make acquaintance with salt or pepper.
I would not go up to the table, so Mary came to
where I sat in a corner, and, while handing out the tin
plate, asked:</p>
<p class="c010">“Have ye any pennies about ye, dearie?”</p>
<p class="c010">“What?” I said, in my surprise.</p>
<p class="c010">“Have ye any pennies, dearie, that ye could give me.
They’ll take them all from ye any way, dearie, so I might
as well have them.”</p>
<p class="c010">I understood it fully now, but I had no intention of
feeing Mary so early in the game, fearing it would have
an influence on her treatment of me, so I said I had lost
my purse, which was quite true. But though I did not
give Mary any money, she was none the less kind to me.
When I objected to the tin plate in which she had
brought my food she fetched a china one for me, and
when I found it impossible to eat the food she presented
she gave me a glass of milk and a soda cracker.</p>
<p class="c010">All the windows in the hall were open and the cold air
began to tell on my Southern blood. It grew so cold indeed
as to be almost unbearable, and I complained of it
to Miss Scott and Miss Ball. But they answered curtly
that as I was in a charity place I could not expect much
else. All the other women were suffering from the cold,
and the nurses themselves had to wear heavy garments to
keep themselves warm. I asked if I could go to bed.
They said “No!” At last Miss Scott got an old gray
shawl, and shaking some of the moths out of it, told me
to put it on.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s rather a bad-looking shawl,” I said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, some people would get along better if they
were not so proud,” said Miss Scott. “People on
charity should not expect anything and should not complain.”</p>
<p class="c010">So I put the moth-eaten shawl, with all its musty
smell, around me, and sat down on a wicker chair, wondering
what would come next, whether I should freeze to
death or survive. My nose was very cold, so I covered
up my head and was in a half doze, when the shawl was
suddenly jerked from my face and a strange man and
Miss Scott stood before me. The man proved to be a
doctor, and his first greetings were:</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ve seen that face before.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Then you know me?” I asked, with a great show of
eagerness that I did not feel.</p>
<p class="c010">“I think I do. Where did you come from?”</p>
<p class="c010">“From home.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Where is home?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t you know? Cuba.”</p>

![Positively Demented](https://ucarecdn.com/de38808a-9cda-4ab1-9bf2-9c59342688ef/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-2.jpg "Positively Demented")

<p class="c010">He then sat down beside me, felt my pulse, and examined
my tongue, and at last said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Tell Miss Scott all about yourself.”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, I will not. I will not talk with women.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What do you do in New York?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nothing.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Can you work?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, senor.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Tell me, are you a woman of the town?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not understand you,” I replied, heartily disgusted
with him.</p>
<p class="c010">“I mean have you allowed the men to provide for you
and keep you?”</p>
<p class="c010">I felt like slapping him in the face, but I had to maintain
my composure, so I simply said:</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not know what you are talking about. I always
lived at home.”</p>
<p class="c010">After many more questions, fully as useless and senseless,
he left me and began to talk with the nurse. “Positively
demented,” he said. “I consider it a hopeless
case. She needs to be put where some one will take care
of her.”</p>
<p class="c010">And so I passed my second medical expert.</p>
<p class="c010">After this, I began to have a smaller regard for the
ability of doctors than I ever had before, and a greater
one for myself. I felt sure now that no doctor could tell
whether people were insane or not, so long as the case
was not violent.</p>
<p class="c010">Later in the afternoon a boy and a woman came. The
woman sat down on a bench, while the boy went in and
talked with Miss Scott. In a short time he came out,
and, just nodding good-bye to the woman, who was his
mother, went away. She did not look insane, but as she
was German I could not learn her story. Her name,
however, was Mrs. Louise Schanz. She seemed quite
lost, but when the nurses put her at some sewing she did
her work well and quickly. At three in the afternoon
all the patients were given a gruel broth, and at five a
cup of tea and a piece of bread. I was favored; for
when they saw that it was impossible for me to eat the
bread or drink the stuff honored by the name of tea, they
gave me a cup of milk and a cracker, the same as I had
had at noon.</p>
<p class="c010">Just as the gas was being lighted another patient was
added. She was a young girl, twenty-five years old.
She told me that she had just gotten up from a sick bed.
Her appearance confirmed her story. She looked like
one who had had a severe attack of fever. “I am now
suffering from nervous debility,” she said, “and my
friends have sent me here to be treated for it.” I did not
tell her where she was, and she seemed quite satisfied.
At 6.15 Miss Ball said that she wanted to go away, and
so we would all have to go to bed. Then each of us—we
now numbered six—were assigned a room and told to undress.
I did so, and was given a short, cotton-flannel
gown to wear during the night. Then she took every
particle of the clothing I had worn during the day, and,
making it up in a bundle, labeled it “Brown,” and
took it away. The iron-barred window was locked, and
Miss Ball, after giving me an extra blanket, which, she
said, was a favor rarely granted, went out and left me
alone. The bed was not a comfortable one. It was so
hard, indeed, that I could not make a dent in it; and
the pillow was stuffed with straw. Under the sheet was
an oilcloth spread. As the night grew colder I tried to
warm that oilcloth. I kept on trying, but when morning
dawned and it was still as cold as when I went to bed,
and had reduced me, too, to the temperature of an iceberg,
I gave it up as an impossible task.</p>
<p class="c010">I had hoped to get some rest on this my first night in
an insane asylum. But I was doomed to disappointment.
When the night nurses came in they were curious to see
me and to find out what I was like. No sooner had they
left than I heard some one at the door inquiring for
Nellie Brown, and I began to tremble, fearing always
that my sanity would be discovered. By listening to the
conversation I found it was a reporter in search of me,
and I heard him ask for my clothing so that he might
examine it. I listened quite anxiously to the talk about
me, and was relieved to learn that I was considered hopelessly
insane. That was encouraging. After the reporter
left I heard new arrivals, and I learned that a doctor
was there and intended to see me. For what purpose
I knew not, and I imagined all sorts of horrible things,
such as examinations and the rest of it, and when they
got to my room I was shaking with more than fear.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown, here is the doctor; he wishes to speak
with you,” said the nurse. If that’s all he wanted I
thought I could endure it. I removed the blanket which
I had put over my head in my sudden fright and looked
up. The sight was reassuring.</p>
<p class="c010">He was a handsome young man. He had the air and
address of a gentleman. Some people have since censured
this action; but I feel sure, even if it was a little
indiscreet, that the young doctor only meant kindness to
me. He came forward, seated himself on the side of my
bed, and put his arm soothingly around my shoulders.
It was a terrible task to play insane before this young
man, and only a girl can sympathize with me in my position.</p>
<p class="c010">“How do you feel to-night, Nellie?” he asked, easily.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I feel all right.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you are sick, you know,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, am I?” I replied, and I turned my head on the
pillow and smiled.</p>
<p class="c010">“When did you leave Cuba, Nellie?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, you know my home?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, very well. Don’t you remember me? I remember
you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you?” and I mentally said I should not forget
him. He was accompanied by a friend who never ventured
a remark, but stood staring at me as I lay in bed.
After a great many questions, to which I answered truthfully,
he left me. Then came other troubles. All night
long the nurses read one to the other aloud, and I know
that the other patients, as well as myself, were unable to
sleep. Every half-hour or hour they would walk heavily
down the halls, their boot-heels resounding like the
march of a private of dragoons, and take a look at every
patient. Of course this helped to keep us awake. Then,
as it came toward morning, they began to beat eggs for
breakfast, and the sound made me realize how horribly
hungry I was. Occasional yells and cries came from the
male department, and that did not aid in making the
night pass more cheerfully. Then the ambulance-gong,
as it brought in more unfortunates, sounded as a knell to
life and liberty. Thus I passed my first night as an insane
girl at Bellevue.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter7">CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class="large">THE GOAL IN SIGHT.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">At 6 o’clock on Sunday morning, Sept. 25, the nurses
pulled the covering from my bed. “Come, it’s time for
you to get out of bed,” they said, and opened the window
and let in the cold breeze. My clothing was then returned
to me. After dressing I was shown to a washstand,
where all the other patients were trying to rid
their faces of all traces of sleep. At 7 o’clock we were
given some horrible mess, which Mary told us was
chicken broth. The cold, from which we had suffered
enough the day previous, was bitter, and when I complained
to the nurse she said it was one of the rules of
the institution not to turn the heat on until October, and
so we would have to endure it, as the steam-pipes had not
even been put in order. The night nurses then, arming
themselves with scissors, began to play manicure on the
patients. They cut my nails to the quick, as they did
those of several of the other patients. Shortly after this
a handsome young doctor made his appearance and I was
conducted into the sitting-room.</p>
<p class="c010">“Who are you?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Moreno,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Then why did you give the name of Brown?” he
asked. “What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nothing. I did not want to come here, but they
brought me. I want to go away. Won’t you let me
out?”</p>
<p class="c010">“If I take you out will you stay with me? Won’t you
run away from me when you get on the street?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I can’t promise that I will not,” I answered, with a
smile and a sigh, for he was handsome.</p>
<p class="c010">He asked me many other questions. Did I ever see
faces on the wall? Did I ever hear voices around? I answered
him to the best of my ability.</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you ever hear voices at night?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, there is so much talking I cannot sleep.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I thought so,” he said to himself. Then turning to
me, he asked: “What do these voices say?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I do not listen to them always. But sometimes,
very often, they talk about Nellie Brown, and then
on other subjects that do not interest me half so much,”
I answered, truthfully.</p>
<p class="c010">“That will do,” he said to Miss Scott, who was just on
the outside.</p>
<p class="c010">“Can I go away?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” he said, with a satisfied laugh, “we’ll soon
send you away.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It is so very cold here, I want to go out,” I said.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s true,” he said to Miss Scott. “The cold is
almost unbearable in here, and you will have some cases
of pneumonia if you are not careful.”</p>
<p class="c010">With this I was led away and another patient was taken
in. I sat right outside the door and waited to hear how
he would test the sanity of the other patients. With
little variation the examination was exactly the same as
mine. All the patients were asked if they saw faces on
the wall, heard voices, and what they said. I might also
add each patient denied any such peculiar freaks of sight
and hearing. At 10 o’clock we were given a cup of unsalted
beef tea; at noon a bit of cold meat and a potatoe,
at 3 o’clock a cup of oatmeal gruel and at 5.30 a cup of
tea and a slice of unbuttered bread. We were all cold
and hungry. After the physician left we were given
shawls and told to walk up and down the halls in order
to get warm. During the day the pavilion was visited
by a number of people who were curious to see the crazy
girl from Cuba. I kept my head covered, on the plea of
being cold, for fear some of the reporters would recognize
me. Some of the visitors were apparently in search of
a missing girl, for I was made to take down the shawl repeatedly,
and after they looked at me they would say, “I
don’t know her,” or “she is not the one,” for which I
was secretly thankful. Warden O’Rourke visited me,
and tried his arts on an examination. Then he brought
some well-dressed women and some gentlemen at different
times to have a glance at the mysterious Nellie
Brown.</p>
<p class="c010">The reporters were the most troublesome. Such a
number of them! And they were all so bright and clever
that I was terribly frightened lest they should see that I
was sane. They were very kind and nice to me, and
very gentle in all their questionings. My late visitor the
night previous came to the window while some reporters
were interviewing me in the sitting-room, and told the
nurse to allow them to see me, as they would be of assistance
in finding some clew as to my identity.</p>
<p class="c010">In the afternoon Dr. Field came and examined me.
He asked me only a few questions, and ones that had no
bearing on such a case. The chief question was of my
home and friends, and if I had any lovers or had ever
been married. Then he made me stretch out my arms
and move my fingers, which I did without the least hesitation,
yet I heard him say my case was hopeless. The
other patients were asked the same questions.</p>
<p class="c010">As the doctor was about to leave the pavilion Miss Tillie
Mayard discovered that she was in an insane ward.
She went to Dr. Field and asked him why she had been
sent there.</p>
<p class="c010">“Have you just found out you are in an insane asylum?”
asked the doctor.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes; my friends said they were sending me to a convalescent
ward to be treated for nervous debility, from
which I am suffering since my illness. I want to get out
of this place immediately.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, you won’t get out in a hurry,” he said, with a
quick laugh.</p>
<p class="c010">“If you know anything at all,” she responded, “you
should be able to tell that I am perfectly sane. Why
don’t you test me?”</p>
<p class="c010">“We know all we want to on that score,” said the
doctor, and he left the poor girl condemned to an insane
asylum, probably for life, without giving her one feeble
chance to prove her sanity.</p>
<p class="c010">Sunday night was but a repetition of Saturday. All
night long we were kept awake by the talk of the nurses
and their heavy walking through the uncarpeted halls.
On Monday morning we were told that we should be taken
away at 1.30. The nurses questioned me unceasingly
about my home, and all seemed to have an idea that I had
a lover who had cast me forth on the world and wrecked
my brain. The morning brought many reporters. How
untiring they are in their efforts to get something new.
Miss Scott refused to allow me to be seen, however, and
for this I was thankful. Had they been given free access
to me, I should probably not have been a mystery long,
for many of them knew me by sight. Warden O’Rourke
came for a final visit and had a short conversation with
me. He wrote his name in my notebook, saying to the
nurse that I would forget all about it in an hour. I
smiled and thought I wasn’t sure of that. Other people
called to see me, but none knew me or could give any information
about me.</p>
<p class="c010">Noon came. I grew nervous as the time approached
to leave for the Island. I dreaded every new arrival,
fearful that my secret would be discovered at the last
moment. Then I was given a shawl and my hat and
gloves. I could hardly put them on, my nerves were so
unstrung. At last the attendant arrived, and I bade
good-bye to Mary as I slipped “a few pennies” into her
hand. “God bless you,” she said; “I shall pray for you.
Cheer up, dearie. You are young, and will get over
this.” I told her I hoped so, and then I said good-bye to
Miss Scott in Spanish. The rough-looking attendant
twisted his arms around mine, and half-led, half-dragged
me to an ambulance. A crowd of the students had assembled,
and they watched us curiously. I put the
shawl over my face, and sank thankfully into the wagon.
Miss Neville, Miss Mayard, Mrs. Fox, and Mrs. Schanz
were all put in after me, one at a time. A man got in
with us, the doors were locked, and we were driven out
of the gates in great style on toward the Insane Asylum
and victory! The patients made no move to escape. The
odor of the male attendant’s breath was enough to make
one’s head swim.</p>
<p class="c010">When we reached the wharf such a mob of people
crowded around the wagon that the police were called to
put them away, so that we could reach the boat. I was
the last of the procession. I was escorted down the
plank, the fresh breeze blowing the attendants’ whisky
breath into my face until I staggered. I was taken into
a dirty cabin, where I found my companions seated on a
narrow bench. The small windows were closed, and,
with the smell of the filthy room, the air was stifling.
At one end of the cabin was a small bunk in such a condition
that I had to hold my nose when I went near it.
A sick girl was put on it. An old woman, with an
enormous bonnet and a dirty basket filled with chunks
of bread and bits of scrap meat, completed our company.
The door was guarded by two female attendants. One
was clad in a dress made of bed-ticking and the other
was dressed with some attempt at style. They were
coarse, massive women, and expectorated tobacco juice
about on the floor in a manner more skillful than charming.
One of these fearful creatures seemed to have much
faith in the power of the glance on insane people, for,
when any one of us would move or go to look out of the
high window she would say “Sit down,” and would
lower her brows and glare in a way that was simply terrifying.
While guarding the door they talked with some
men on the outside. They discussed the number of patients
and then their own affairs in a manner neither
edifying nor refined.</p>

<p class="c010">The boat stopped and the old woman and the sick girl
were taken off. The rest of us were told to sit still. At
the next stop my companions were taken off, one at a
time. I was last, and it seemed to require a man and a
woman to lead me up the plank to reach the shore. An
ambulance was standing there, and in it were the four
other patients.</p>
<p class="c010">“What is this place?” I asked of the man, who had his
fingers sunk into the flesh of my arm.</p>
<p class="c010">“Blackwell’s Island, an insane place, where you’ll
never get out of.”</p>
<p class="c010">With this I was shoved into the ambulance, the springboard
was put up, an officer and a mail-carrier jumped
on behind, and I was swiftly driven to the Insane Asylum
on Blackwell’s Island.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter8">CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class="large">INSIDE THE MAD-HOUSE.</span></h3>

As the wagon was rapidly driven through
the beautiful lawns up to the asylum my
feelings of satisfaction at having attained
the object of my work were greatly dampened
by the look of distress on the faces
of my companions. Poor women, they
had no hopes of a speedy delivery. They
were being driven to a prison, through
no fault of their own, in all probability
for life. In comparison, how much
easier it would be to walk to the gallows
than to this tomb of living horrors! On the wagon sped,
and I, as well as my comrades, gave a despairing farewell
glance at freedom as we came in sight of the long stone
buildings. We passed one low building, and the stench
was so horrible that I was compelled to hold my breath,
and I mentally decided that it was the kitchen. I afterward
found I was correct in my surmise, and smiled at
the signboard at the end of the walk: “Visitors are not
allowed on this road.” I don’t think the sign would be
necessary if they once tried the road, especially on a warm
day.</p>

<p class="c010">The wagon stopped, and the nurse and officer in charge
told us to get out. The nurse added: “Thank God!
they came quietly.” We obeyed orders to go ahead up a
flight of narrow, stone steps, which had evidently been
built for the accommodation of people who climb stairs
three at a time. I wondered if my companions knew
where we were, so I said to Miss Tillie Mayard:</p>
<p class="c010">“Where are we?”</p>
<p class="c010">“At the Blackwell’s Island Lunatic Asylum,” she answered,
sadly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Are you crazy?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” she replied; “but as we have been sent here
we will have to be quiet until we find some means of escape.
They will be few, though, if all the doctors, as
Dr. Field, refuse to listen to me or give me a chance to
prove my sanity.” We were ushered into a narrow vestibule,
and the door was locked behind us.</p>
<p class="c010">In spite of the knowledge of my sanity and the assurance
that I would be released in a few days, my heart gave
a sharp twinge. Pronounced insane by four expert doctors
and shut up behind the unmerciful bolts and bars of
a mad-house! Not to be confined alone, but to be a companion,
day and night, of senseless, chattering lunatics;
to sleep with them, to eat with them, to be considered one
of them, was an uncomfortable position. Timidly we
followed the nurse up the long uncarpeted hall to a room
filled by so-called crazy women. We were told to sit
down, and some of the patients kindly made room for us.
They looked at us curiously, and one came up to me and
asked:</p>
<p class="c010">“Who sent you here?”</p>
<p class="c010">“The doctors,” I answered.</p>
<p class="c010">“What for?” she persisted.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, they say I am insane,” I admitted.</p>
<p class="c010">“Insane!” she repeated, incredulously. “It cannot
be seen in your face.”</p>
<p class="c010">This woman was too clever, I concluded, and was glad
to answer the roughly given orders to follow the nurse to
see the doctor. This nurse, Miss Grupe, by the way,
had a nice German face, and if I had not detected certain
hard lines about the mouth I might have expected,
as did my companions, to receive but kindness from her.
She left us in a small waiting-room at the end of the hall,
and left us alone while she went into a small office opening
into the sitting or receiving-room.</p>
<p class="c010">“I like to go down in the wagon,” she said to the invisible
party on the inside. “It helps to break up the
day.” He answered her that the open air improved her
looks, and she again appeared before us all smiles and
simpers.</p>

<p class="c010">“Come here, Tillie Mayard,” she said. Miss Mayard
obeyed, and, though I could not see into the office, I
could hear her gently but firmly pleading her case. All
her remarks were as rational as any I ever heard, and I
thought no good physician could help but be impressed
with her story. She told of her recent illness, that she
was suffering from nervous debility. She begged that
they try all their tests for insanity, if they had any, and
give her justice. Poor girl, how my heart ached for her!
I determined then and there that I would try by every
means to make my mission of benefit to my suffering sisters;
that I would show how they are committed without
ample trial. Without one word of sympathy or encouragement
she was brought back to where we sat.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Louise Schanz was taken into the presence of Dr.
Kinier, the medical man.</p>
<p class="c010">“Your name?” he asked, loudly. She answered in
German, saying she did not speak English nor could she
understand it. However, when he said Mrs. Louise
Schanz, she said “Yah, yah.” Then he tried other
questions, and when he found she could not understand
one word of English, he said to Miss Grupe:</p>
<p class="c010">“You are German; speak to her for me.”</p>
<p class="c010">Miss Grupe proved to be one of those people who are
ashamed of their nationality, and she refused, saying she
could understand but few words of her mother tongue.</p>
<p class="c010">“You know you speak German. Ask this woman
what her husband does,” and they both laughed as if
they were enjoying a joke.</p>
<p class="c010">“I can’t speak but a few words,” she protested, but at
last she managed to ascertain the occupation of Mr.
Schanz.</p>
<p class="c010">“Now, what was the use of lying to me?” asked the
doctor, with a laugh which dispelled the rudeness.</p>
<p class="c010">“I can’t speak any more,” she said, and she did not.</p>
<p class="c010">Thus was Mrs. Louise Schanz consigned to the asylum
without a chance of making herself understood. Can
such carelessness be excused, I wonder, when it is so easy
to get an interpreter? If the confinement was but for a
few days one might question the necessity. But here was
a woman taken without her own consent from a free world
to an asylum and there given no chance to prove her sanity.
Confined most probably for life behind asylum bars, without
even being told in her language the why and wherefore.
Compare this with a criminal, who is given every
chance to prove his innocence. Who would not rather be
a murderer and take the chance for life than be declared
insane, without hope of escape? Mrs. Schanz begged in
German to know where she was, and pleaded for liberty.
Her voice broken by sobs, she was led unheard out to us.</p>

<p class="c010">Mrs. Fox was then put through this weak, trifling examination
and brought from the office, convicted. Miss
Annie Neville took her turn, and I was again left to the
last. I had by this time determined to act as I do when
free, except that I would refuse to tell who I was or where
my home was.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter9">CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class="large">AN EXPERT(?) AT WORK.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">“Nellie Brown, the doctor wants you,” said Miss
Grupe. I went in and was told to sit down opposite Dr.
Kinier at the desk.</p>
<p class="c010">“What is your name?” he asked, without looking up.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown,” I replied, easily.</p>
<p class="c010">“Where is your home?” writing what I had said down
in a large book.</p>
<p class="c010">“In Cuba.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh!” he ejaculated, with sudden understanding—then,
addressing the nurse:</p>
<p class="c010">“Did you see anything in the papers about her?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” she replied, “I saw a long account of this girl in
the <cite>Sun</cite> on Sunday.” Then the doctor said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Keep her here until I go to the office and see the notice
again.”</p>
<p class="c010">He left us, and I was relieved of my hat and shawl.
On his return, he said he had been unable to find the
paper, but he related the story of my <i>debut</i>, as he had
read it, to the nurse.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s the color of her eyes?”</p>
<p class="c010">Miss Grupe looked, and answered “gray,” although
everybody had always said my eyes were brown or hazel.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s your age?” he asked; and as I answered,
“Nineteen last May,” he turned to the nurse, and said,
“When do you get your next pass?” This I ascertained
was a leave of absence, or “a day off.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Next Saturday,” she said, with a laugh.</p>
<p class="c010">“You will go to town?” and they both laughed as she
answered in the affirmative, and he said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Measure her.” I was stood under a measure, and it
was brought down tightly on my head.</p>
<p class="c010">“What is it?” asked the doctor.</p>
<p class="c010">“Now you know I can’t tell,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, you can; go ahead. What height?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know; there are some figures there, but I
can’t tell.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, you can. Now look and tell me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I can’t; do it yourself,” and they laughed again as
the doctor left his place at the desk and came forward to
see for himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“Five feet five inches; don’t you see?” he said, taking
her hand and touching the figures.</p>
<p class="c010">By her voice I knew she did not understand yet, but
that was no concern of mine, as the doctor seemed to find
a pleasure in aiding her. Then I was put on the scales,
and she worked around until she got them to balance.</p>
<p class="c010">“How much?” asked the doctor, having resumed his
position at the desk.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know. You will have to see for yourself,”
she replied, calling him by his Christian name, which I
have forgotten. He turned and also addressing her by
her baptismal name, he said:</p>
<p class="c010">“You are getting too fresh!” and they both laughed.
I then told the weight—112 pounds—to the nurse, and
she in turn told the doctor.</p>
<p class="c010">“What time are you going to supper?” he asked, and
she told him. He gave the nurse more attention than he
did me, and asked her six questions to every one of me.
Then he wrote my fate in the book before him. I said,
“I am not sick and I do not want to stay here. No one
has a right to shut me up in this manner.” He took no
notice of my remarks, and having completed his writings,
as well as his talk with the nurse for the moment, he said
that would do, and with my companions, I went back to
the sitting-room.</p>
<p class="c010">“You play the piano?” they asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, yes; ever since I was a child,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">Then they insisted that I should play, and they seated
me on a wooden chair before an old-fashioned square. I
struck a few notes, and the untuned response sent a grinding
chill through me.</p>
<p class="c010">“How horrible,” I exclaimed, turning to a nurse, Miss
McCarten, who stood at my side. “I never touched a
piano as much out of tune.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s a pity of you,” she said, spitefully; “we’ll have
to get one made to order for you.”</p>
<p class="c010">I began to play the variations of “Home Sweet Home.”
The talking ceased and every patient sat silent, while my
cold fingers moved slowly and stiffly over the keyboard.
I finished in an aimless fashion and refused all requests
to play more. Not seeing an available place to sit, I still
occupied the chair in the front of the piano while I
“sized up” my surroundings.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a long, bare room, with bare yellow benches encircling
it. These benches, which were perfectly straight,
and just as uncomfortable, would hold five people, although
in almost every instance six were crowded on
them. Barred windows, built about five feet from the
floor, faced the two double doors which led into the hall.
The bare white walls were somewhat relieved by three
lithographs, one of Fritz Emmet and the others of negro
minstrels. In the center of the room was a large table
covered with a white bed-spread, and around it sat the
nurses. Everything was spotlessly clean and I thought
what good workers the nurses must be to keep such
order. In a few days after how I laughed at my own
stupidity to think the nurses would work. When they
found I would not play any more, Miss McCarten came
up to me saying, roughly:</p>
<p class="c010">“Get away from here,” and closed the piano with a
bang.</p>
<p class="c010">“Brown, come here,” was the next order I got from a
rough, red-faced woman at the table. “What have you
on?”</p>
<p class="c010">“My clothing,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">She lifted my dress and skirts and wrote down one pair
shoes, one pair stockings, one cloth dress, one straw
sailor hat, and so on.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3 id="chapter10">CHAPTER X.<br> <span class="large">MY FIRST SUPPER.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">This examination over, we heard some one yell, “Go
out into the hall.” One of the patients kindly explained
that this was an invitation to supper. We late comers
tried to keep together, so we entered the hall and stood
at the door where all the women had crowded. How we
shivered as we stood there! The windows were open and
the draught went whizzing through the hall. The patients
looked blue with cold, and the minutes stretched
into a quarter of an hour. At last one of the nurses went
forward and unlocked a door, through which we all
crowded to a landing of the stairway. Here again came
a long halt directly before an open window.</p>
<p class="c010">“How very imprudent for the attendants to keep these
thinly clad women standing here in the cold,” said Miss
Neville.</p>
<p class="c010">I looked at the poor crazy captives shivering, and
added, emphatically, “It’s horribly brutal.” While
they stood there I thought I would not relish supper that
night. They looked so lost and hopeless. Some were
chattering nonsense to invisible persons, others were
laughing or crying aimlessly, and one old, gray-haired
woman was nudging me, and, with winks and sage noddings
of the head and pitiful uplifting of the eyes and
hands, was assuring me that I must not mind the poor
creatures, as they were all mad. “Stop at the heater,”
was then ordered, “and get in line, two by two.”
“Mary, get a companion.” “How many times must I
tell you to keep in line?” “Stand still,” and, as the
orders were issued, a shove and a push were administered,
and often a slap on the ears. After this third and
final halt, we were marched into a long, narrow dining-room,
where a rush was made for the table.</p>
<p class="c010">The table reached the length of the room and was
uncovered and uninviting. Long benches without backs
were put for the patients to sit on, and over these they
had to crawl in order to face the table. Placed close
together all along the table were large dressing-bowls
filled with a pinkish-looking stuff which the patients
called tea. By each bowl was laid a piece of bread, cut
thick and buttered. A small saucer containing five
prunes accompanied the bread. One fat woman made a
rush, and jerking up several saucers from those around
her emptied their contents into her own saucer. Then
while holding to her own bowl she lifted up another and
drained its contents at one gulp. This she did to a second
bowl in shorter time than it takes to tell it. Indeed,
I was so amused at her successful grabbings that when I
looked at my own share the woman opposite, without so
much as by your leave, grabbed my bread and left me
without any.</p>
<p class="c010">Another patient, seeing this, kindly offered me hers,
but I declined with thanks and turned to the nurse and
asked for more. As she flung a thick piece down on the
table she made some remark about the fact that if I forgot
where my home was I had not forgotten how to eat.
I tried the bread, but the butter was so horrible that one
could not eat it. A blue-eyed German girl on the opposite
side of the table told me I could have bread unbuttered
if I wished, and that very few were able to eat the
butter. I turned my attention to the prunes and found
that very few of them would be sufficient. A patient
near asked me to give them to her. I did so. My bowl
of tea was all that was left. I tasted, and one taste was
enough. It had no sugar, and it tasted as if it had been
made in copper. It was as weak as water. This was also
transferred to a hungrier patient, in spite of the protest
of Miss Neville.</p>
<p class="c010">“You must force the food down,” she said, “else you
will be sick, and who knows but what, with these surroundings,
you may go crazy. To have a good brain the
stomach must be cared for.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It is impossible for me to eat that stuff,” I replied,
and, despite all her urging, I ate nothing that night.</p>
<p class="c010">It did not require much time for the patients to consume
all that was eatable on the table, and then we got
our orders to form in line in the hall. When this was
done the doors before us were unlocked and we were
ordered to proceed back to the sitting-room. Many of
the patients crowded near us, and I was again urged to
play, both by them and by the nurses. To please the
patients I promised to play and Miss Tillie Mayard was
to sing. The first thing she asked me to play was
“Rock-a-bye Baby,” and I did so. She sang it beautifully.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter11">CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class="large">IN THE BATH.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">A few more songs and we were told to go with Miss
Grupe. We were taken into a cold, wet bathroom, and
I was ordered to undress. Did I protest? Well, I never
grew so earnest in my life as when I tried to beg off.
They said if I did not they would use force and that it
would not be very gentle. At this I noticed one of the
craziest women in the ward standing by the filled bathtub
with a large, discolored rag in her hands. She was chattering
away to herself and chuckling in a manner which
seemed to me fiendish. I knew now what was to be done
with me. I shivered. They began to undress me, and
one by one they pulled off my clothes. At last everything
was gone excepting one garment. “I will not remove
it,” I said vehemently, but they took it off. I gave one
glance at the group of patients gathered at the door
watching the scene, and I jumped into the bathtub with
more energy than grace.</p>

<p class="c010">The water was ice-cold, and I again began to protest.
How useless it all was! I begged, at least, that the patients
be made to go away, but was ordered to shut up.
The crazy woman began to scrub me. I can find no other
word that will express it but scrubbing. From a small
tin pan she took some soft soap and rubbed it all over me,
even all over my face and my pretty hair. I was at last
past seeing or speaking, although I had begged that my
hair be left untouched. Rub, rub, rub, went the old
woman, chattering to herself. My teeth chattered and
my limbs were goose-fleshed and blue with cold. Suddenly
I got, one after the other, three buckets of water over my
head—ice-cold water, too—into my eyes, my ears, my nose
and my mouth. I think I experienced some of the sensations
of a drowning person as they dragged me, gasping,
shivering and quaking, from the tub. For once I did look
insane. I caught a glance of the indescribable look on
the faces of my companions, who had witnessed my fate and
knew theirs was surely following. Unable to control myself
at the absurd picture I presented, I burst into roars
of laughter. They put me, dripping wet, into a short
canton flannel slip, labeled across the extreme end in large
black letters, “Lunatic Asylum, B. I., H. 6.” The letters
meant Blackwell’s Island, Hall 6.</p>
<p class="c010">By this time Miss Mayard had been undressed, and,
much as I hated my recent bath, I would have taken another
if by it I could have saved her the experience.
Imagine plunging that sick girl into a cold bath when it
made me, who has never been ill, shake as if with ague.
I heard her explain to Miss Grupe that her head was still
sore from her illness. Her hair was short and had mostly
come out, and she asked that the crazy woman be made
to rub more gently, but Miss Grupe said:</p>
<p class="c010">“There isn’t much fear of hurting you. Shut up, or
you’ll get it worse.” Miss Mayard did shut up, and that
was my last look at her for the night.</p>
<p class="c010">I was hurried into a room where there were six beds,
and had been put into bed when some one came along
and jerked me out again, saying:</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown has to be put in a room alone to-night,
for I suppose she’s noisy.”</p>
<p class="c010">I was taken to room 28 and left to try and make an impression
on the bed. It was an impossible task. The
bed had been made high in the center and sloping on
either side. At the first touch my head flooded the pillow
with water, and my wet slip transferred some of its
dampness to the sheet. When Miss Grupe came in I
asked if I could not have a night-gown.</p>
<p class="c010">“We have no such things in this institution,” she
said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not like to sleep without,” I replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I don’t care about that,” she said. “You are
in a public institution now, and you can’t expect to get
anything. This is charity, and you should be thankful
for what you get.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But the city pays to keep these places up,” I urged,
“and pays people to be kind to the unfortunates brought
here.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, you don’t need to expect any kindness here,
for you won’t get it,” she said, and she went out and
closed the door.</p>

![Her Bedroom](https://ucarecdn.com/2eccf4ab-8e52-4d42-baa8-f1917be1ab9b/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-6.jpg "Her Bedroom")

<p class="c010">A sheet and an oilcloth were under me, and a sheet and
black wool blanket above. I never felt anything so annoying
as that wool blanket as I tried to keep it around
my shoulders to stop the chills from getting underneath.
When I pulled it up I left my feet bare, and when I pulled
it down my shoulders were exposed. There was absolutely
nothing in the room but the bed and myself. As
the door had been locked I imagined I should be left
alone for the night, but I heard the sound of the heavy
tread of two women down the hall. They stopped at
every door, unlocked it, and in a few moments I could
hear them relock it. This they did without the least attempt
at quietness down the whole length of the opposite
side of the hall and up to my room. Here they paused.
The key was inserted in the lock and turned. I
watched those about to enter. In they came, dressed in
brown and white striped dresses, fastened by brass buttons,
large, white aprons, a heavy green cord about the waist,
from which dangled a bunch of large keys, and small, white
caps on their heads. Being dressed as were the attendants
of the day, I knew they were nurses. The first one
carried a lantern, and she flashed its light into my face
while she said to her assistant:</p>
<p class="c010">“This is Nellie Brown.” Looking at her, I asked:</p>
<p class="c010">“Who are you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“The night nurse, my dear,” she replied, and, wishing
that I would sleep well, she went out and locked the door
after her. Several times during the night they came
into my room, and even had I been able to sleep, the unlocking
of the heavy door, their loud talking, and heavy
tread, would have awakened me.</p>
<p class="c010">I could not sleep, so I lay in bed picturing to myself the
horrors in case a fire should break out in the asylum.
Every door is locked separately and the windows are
heavily barred, so that escape is impossible. In the one
building alone there are, I think Dr. Ingram told me,
some three hundred women. They are locked, one to
ten to a room. It is impossible to get out unless these
doors are unlocked. A fire is not improbable, but one of
the most likely occurrences. Should the building burn,
the jailers or nurses would never think of releasing their
crazy patients. This I can prove to you later when I
come to tell of their cruel treatment of the poor things
intrusted to their care. As I say, in case of fire, not a
dozen women could escape. All would be left to roast
to death. Even if the nurses were kind, which they are
not, it would require more presence of mind than women
of their class possess to risk the flames and their own
lives while they unlocked the hundred doors for the insane
prisoners. Unless there is a change there will some
day be a tale of horror never equaled.</p>
In this connection is an amusing incident which happened
just previous to my release. I was talking with
Dr. Ingram about many things, and at last told him
what I thought would be the result of a fire.</p>
<p class="c010">“The nurses are expected to open the doors,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“But you know positively that they would not wait
to do that,” I said, “and these women would burn to
death.”</p>
<p class="c010">He sat silent, unable to contradict my assertion.</p>
<p class="c010">“Why don’t you have it changed?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“What can I do?” he replied. “I offer suggestions
until my brain is tired, but what good does it do? What
would you do?” he asked, turning to me, the proclaimed
insane girl.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I should insist on them having locks put in, as
I have seen in some places, that by turning a crank at
the end of the hall you can lock or unlock every door on
the one side. Then there would be some chance of escape.
Now, every door being locked separately, there is
absolutely none.”</p>
<p class="c010">Dr. Ingram turned to me with an anxious look on his
kind face as he asked, slowly:</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown, what institution have you been an inmate
of before you came here?”</p>
<p class="c010">“None. I never was confined in any institution, except
boarding-school, in my life.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Where then did you see the locks you have described?”</p>
<p class="c010">I had seen them in the new Western Penitentiary at
Pittsburg, Pa., but I did not dare say so. I merely answered:</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I have seen them in a place I was in—I mean as
a visitor.”</p>
<p class="c010">“There is only one place I know of where they have
those locks,” he said, sadly, “and that is at Sing Sing.”</p>
<p class="c010">The inference is conclusive. I laughed very heartily
over the implied accusation, and tried to assure him that
I had never, up to date, been an inmate of Sing Sing or
even ever visited it.</p>
<p class="c010">Just as the morning began to dawn I went to sleep.
It did not seem many moments until I was rudely awakened
and told to get up, the window being opened and
the clothing pulled off me. My hair was still wet and I
had pains all through me, as if I had the rheumatism.
Some clothing was flung on the floor and I was told to
put it on. I asked for my own, but was told to take
what I got and keep quiet by the apparently head nurse,
Miss Grady. I looked at it. One underskirt made of
coarse dark cotton goods and a cheap white calico dress
with a black spot in it. I tied the strings of the skirt
around me and put on the little dress. It was made, as
are all those worn by the patients, into a straight tight
waist sewed on to a straight skirt. As I buttoned the
waist I noticed the underskirt was about six inches longer
than the upper, and for a moment I sat down on the bed
and laughed at my own appearance. No woman ever
longed for a mirror more than I did at that moment.</p>
<p class="c010">I saw the other patients hurrying past in the hall, so I
decided not to lose anything that might be going on.
We numbered forty-five patients in Hall 6, and were sent
to the bathroom, where there were two coarse towels. I
watched crazy patients who had the most dangerous eruptions
all over their faces dry on the towels and then saw
women with clean skins turn to use them. I went to the
bathtub and washed my face at the running faucet and
my underskirt did duty for a towel.</p>
<p class="c010">Before I had completed my ablutions a bench was
brought into the bathroom. Miss Grupe and Miss McCarten
came in with combs in their hands. We were told
to sit down on the bench, and the hair of forty-five women
was combed with one patient, two nurses, and six combs.
As I saw some of the sore heads combed I thought this was
another dose I had not bargained for. Miss Tillie Mayard
had her own comb, but it was taken from her by Miss
Grady. Oh, that combing! I never realized before what
the expression “I’ll give you a combing” meant, but I
knew then. My hair, all matted and wet from the night
previous, was pulled and jerked, and, after expostulating
to no avail, I set my teeth and endured the pain. They
refused to give me my hairpins, and my hair was arranged
in one plait and tied with a red cotton rag. My
curly bangs refused to stay back, so that at least was left
of my former glory.</p>
<p class="c010">After this we went to the sitting-room and I looked
for my companions. At first I looked vainly, unable to
distinguish them from the other patients, but after
awhile I recognized Miss Mayard by her short hair.</p>
<p class="c010">“How did you sleep after your cold bath?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I almost froze, and then the noise kept me awake.
It’s dreadful! My nerves were so unstrung before I came
here, and I fear I shall not be able to stand the strain.”</p>
<p class="c010">I did the best I could to cheer her. I asked that we
be given additional clothing, at least as much as custom
says women shall wear, but they told me to shut up; that
we had as much as they intended to give us.</p>
<p class="c010">We were compelled to get up at 5.30 o’clock, and at 7.15
we were told to collect in the hall, where the experience
of waiting, as on the evening previous, was repeated.
When we got into the dining-room at last we found a
bowl of cold tea, a slice of buttered bread and a saucer of
oatmeal, with molasses on it, for each patient. I was
hungry, but the food would not down. I asked for unbuttered
bread and was given it. I cannot tell you of
anything which is the same dirty, black color. It was
hard, and in places nothing more than dried dough. I
found a spider in my slice, so I did not eat it. I tried
the oatmeal and molasses, but it was wretched, and so I
endeavored, but without much show of success, to choke
down the tea.</p>
<p class="c010">After we were back to the sitting-room a number of
women were ordered to make the beds, and some of the
patients were put to scrubbing and others given different
duties which covered all the work in the hall. It is not
the attendants who keep the institution so nice for the
poor patients, as I had always thought, but the patients,
who do it all themselves—even to cleaning the nurses’
bedrooms and caring for their clothing.</p>
<p class="c010">About 9.30 the new patients, of which I was one, were
told to go out to see the doctor. I was taken in and my
lungs and my heart were examined by the flirty young
doctor who was the first to see us the day we entered.
The one who made out the report, if I mistake not, was
the assistant superintendent, Ingram. A few questions
and I was allowed to return to the sitting-room.</p>
<p class="c010">I came in and saw Miss Grady with my notebook and
long lead pencil, bought just for the occasion.</p>
<p class="c010">“I want my book and pencil,” I said, quite truthfully.
“It helps me remember things.”</p>
<p class="c010">I was very anxious to get it to make notes in and was
disappointed when she said:</p>
<p class="c010">“You can’t have it, so shut up.”</p>
<p class="c010">Some days after I asked Dr. Ingram if I could have
it, and he promised to consider the matter. When I
again referred to it, he said that Miss Grady said I only
brought a book there; that I had no pencil. I was provoked,
and insisted that I had, whereupon I was advised
to fight against the imaginations of my brain.</p>
<p class="c010">After the housework was completed by the patients,
and as the day was fine, but cold, we were told to go out
in the hall and get on shawls and hats for a walk. Poor
patients! How eager they were for a breath of air; how
eager for a slight release from their prison. They went
swiftly into the hall and there was a skirmish for hats.
Such hats!</p>

<h3 id="chapter12">CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class="large">PROMENADING WITH LUNATICS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">I shall never forget my first walk. When all the patients
had donned the white straw hats, such as bathers
wear at Coney Island, I could not but laugh at their comical
appearances. I could not distinguish one woman
from another. I lost Miss Neville, and had to take my
hat off and search for her. When we met we put our
hats on and laughed at one another. Two by two we
formed in line, and guarded by the attendants we went
out a back way on to the walks.</p>
<p class="c010">We had not gone many paces when I saw, proceeding
from every walk, long lines of women guarded by nurses.
How many there were! Every way I looked I could see
them in the queer dresses, comical straw hats and shawls,
marching slowly around. I eagerly watched the passing
lines and a thrill of horror crept over me at the sight.
Vacant eyes and meaningless faces, and their tongues uttered
meaningless nonsense. One crowd passed and I
noted, by nose as well as eyes, that they were fearfully
dirty.</p>
<p class="c010">“Who are they?” I asked of a patient near me.</p>
<p class="c010">“They are considered the most violent on the island,”
she replied. “They are from the Lodge, the first building
with the high steps.” Some were yelling, some were
cursing, others were singing or praying or preaching, as
the fancy struck them, and they made up the most miserable
collection of humanity I had ever seen. As the
din of their passing faded in the distance there came another
sight I can never forget:</p>
<p class="c010">A long cable rope fastened to wide leather belts, and
these belts locked around the waists of fifty-two women.
At the end of the rope was a heavy iron cart, and in it
two women—one nursing a sore foot, another screaming
at some nurse, saying: “You beat me and I shall not
forget it. You want to kill me,” and then she would
sob and cry. The women “on the rope,” as the patients
call it, were each busy on their individual freaks. Some
were yelling all the while. One who had blue eyes saw
me look at her, and she turned as far as she could, talking
and smiling, with that terrible, horrifying look of
absolute insanity stamped on her. The doctors might
safely judge on her case. The horror of that sight to
one who had never been near an insane person before,
was something unspeakable.</p>
<p class="c010">“God help them!” breathed Miss Neville, “It is so
dreadful I cannot look.”</p>
<p class="c010">On they passed, but for their places to be filled by
more. Can you imagine the sight? According to one
of the physicians there are 1600 insane women on Blackwell’s
Island.</p>
<p class="c010">Mad! What can be half so horrible? My heart thrilled
with pity when I looked on old, gray-haired women talking
aimlessly to space. One woman had on a straight-jacket,
and two women had to drag her along. Crippled,
blind, old, young, homely, and pretty; one senseless
mass of humanity. No fate could be worse.</p>
<p class="c010">I looked at the pretty lawns, which I had once thought
was such a comfort to the poor creatures confined on the
Island, and laughed at my own notions. What enjoyment
is it to them? They are not allowed on the grass—it
is only to look at. I saw some patients eagerly and
caressingly lift a nut or a colored leaf that had fallen on
the path. But they were not permitted to keep them.
The nurses would always compel them to throw their little
bit of God’s comfort away.</p>

![Quiet Inmates Out for a Walk](https://ucarecdn.com/e69cc097-07c3-4c6d-8128-120577f1a480/-/preview/750x750/spot-illustrations-7.jpg "Quiet Inmates Out for a Walk")

<p class="c010">As I passed a low pavilion, where a crowd of helpless
lunatics were confined, I read a motto on the wall, “While
I live I hope.” The absurdity of it struck me forcibly. I
would have liked to put above the gates that open to the
asylum, “He who enters here leaveth hope behind.”</p>
<p class="c010">During the walk I was annoyed a great deal by nurses
who had heard my romantic story calling to those in
charge of us to ask which one I was. I was pointed out
repeatedly.</p>
<p class="c010">It was not long until the dinner hour arrived, and I
was so hungry that I felt I could eat anything. The same
old story of standing for a half and three-quarters of an
hour in the hall was repeated before we got down to our
dinners. The bowls in which we had had our tea were
now filled with soup, and on a plate was one cold boiled
potato and a chunk of beef, which, on investigation,
proved to be slightly spoiled. There were no knives or
forks, and the patients looked fairly savage as they took
the tough beef in their fingers and pulled in opposition
to their teeth. Those toothless or with poor teeth could
not eat it. One tablespoon was given for the soup,
and a piece of bread was the final entree. Butter is
never allowed at dinner nor coffee or tea. Miss Mayard
could not eat, and I saw many of the sick ones turn away
in disgust. I was getting very weak from the want of
food and tried to eat a slice of bread. After the first
few bites hunger asserted itself, and I was able to eat all
but the crusts of the one slice.</p>
<p class="c010">Superintendent Dent went through the sitting-room,
giving an occasional “How do you do?” “How are you
to-day?” here and there among the patients. His voice
was as cold as the hall, and the patients made no movement
to tell him of their sufferings. I asked some of
them to tell how they were suffering from the cold and
insufficiency of clothing, but they replied that the nurse
would beat them if they told.</p>
<p class="c010">I was never so tired as I grew sitting on those benches.
Several of the patients would sit on one foot or sideways
to make a change, but they were always reproved and
told to sit up straight. If they talked they were scolded
and told to shut up; if they wanted to walk around in
order to take the stiffness out of them, they were told to
sit down and be still. What, excepting torture, would
produce insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is a
class of women sent to be cured. I would like the expert
physicians who are condemning me for my action,
which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane
and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from
6 <span class="fss">A. M.</span> until 8 <span class="fss">P. M.</span> on straight-back benches, do not
allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no
reading and let her know nothing of the world or its
doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see
how long it will take to make her insane. Two months
would make her a mental and physical wreck.</p>
<p class="c010">I have described my first day in the asylum, and as my
other nine were exactly the same in the general run of
things it would be tiresome to tell about each. In giving
this story I expect to be contradicted by many who
are exposed. I merely tell in common words, without
exaggeration, of my life in a mad-house for ten days.
The eating was one of the most horrible things. Excepting
the first two days after I entered the asylum, there
was no salt for the food. The hungry and even famishing
women made an attempt to eat the horrible messes.
Mustard and vinegar were put on meat and in soup to
give it a taste, but it only helped to make it worse.
Even that was all consumed after two days, and the patients
had to try to choke down fresh fish, just boiled in
water, without salt, pepper or butter; mutton, beef and
potatoes without the faintest seasoning. The most insane
refused to swallow the food and were threatened
with punishment. In our short walks we passed the
kitchen where food was prepared for the nurses and doctors.
There we got glimpses of melons and grapes and
all kinds of fruits, beautiful white bread and nice meats,
and the hungry feeling would be increased tenfold. I
spoke to some of the physicians, but it had no effect, and
when I was taken away the food was yet unsalted.</p>
<p class="c010">My heart ached to see the sick patients grow sicker
over the table. I saw Miss Tillie Mayard so suddenly
overcome at a bite that she had to rush from the dining-room
and then got a scolding for doing so. When the
patients complained of the food they were told to shut
up; that they would not have as good if they were at
home, and that it was too good for charity patients.</p>
<p class="c010">A German girl, Louise—I have forgotten her last name—did
not eat for several days and at last one morning
she was missing. From the conversation of the nurses I
found she was suffering from a high fever. Poor thing!
She told me she unceasingly prayed for death. I watched
the nurses make a patient carry such food as the well
ones were refusing up to Louise’s room. Think of that
stuff for a fever patient! Of course, she refused it.
Then I saw a nurse, Miss McCarten, go to test her temperature,
and she returned with the report of it being
some 150 degrees. I smiled at the report, and Miss
Grupe, seeing it, asked me how high my temperature had
ever run. I refused to answer. Miss Grady then decided
to try her ability. She returned with the report of
99 degrees.</p>
<p class="c010">Miss Tillie Mayard suffered more than any of us from
the cold, and yet she tried to follow my advice to be cheerful
and try to keep up for a short time. Superintendent
Dent brought in a man to see me. He felt my pulse and
my head and examined my tongue. I told them how
cold it was, and assured them that I did not need medical
aid, but that Miss Mayard did, and they should transfer
their attentions to her. They did not answer me, and I
was pleased to see Miss Mayard leave her place and come
forward to them. She spoke to the doctors and told them
she was ill, but they paid no attention to her. The nurses
came and dragged her back to the bench, and after the doctors
left they said, “After awhile, when you see that the
doctors will not notice you, you will quit running up to
them.” Before the doctors left me I heard one say—I
cannot give it in his exact words—that my pulse and eyes
were not that of an insane girl, but Superintendent Dent
assured him that in cases such as mine such tests failed.
After watching me for awhile he said my face was the
brightest he had ever seen for a lunatic. The nurses had
on heavy undergarments and coats, but they refused to
give us shawls.</p>
<p class="c010">Nearly all night long I listened to a woman cry about
the cold and beg for God to let her die. Another one
yelled “Murder!” at frequent intervals and “Police!” at
others until my flesh felt creepy.</p>
<p class="c010">The second morning, after we had begun our endless
“set” for the day, two of the nurses, assisted by some
patients, brought the woman in who had begged the night
previous for God to take her home. I was not surprised
at her prayer. She appeared easily seventy years old,
and she was blind. Although the halls were freezing-cold,
that old woman had no more clothing on than the
rest of us, which I have described. When she was
brought into the sitting-room and placed on the hard
bench, she cried:</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, what are you doing with me? I am cold, so
cold. Why can’t I stay in bed or have a shawl?” and
then she would get up and endeavor to feel her way to
leave the room. Sometimes the attendants would jerk
her back to the bench, and again they would let her walk
and heartlessly laugh when she bumped against the table
or the edge of the benches. At one time she said the
heavy shoes which charity provides hurt her feet, and she
took them off. The nurses made two patients put them
on her again, and when she did it several times, and
fought against having them on, I counted seven people
at her at once trying to put the shoes on her. The old
woman then tried to lie down on the bench, but they
pulled her up again. It sounded so pitiful to hear her
cry:</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, give me a pillow and pull the covers over me, I
am so cold.”</p>
<p class="c010">At this I saw Miss Grupe sit down on her and run her
cold hands over the old woman’s face and down inside
the neck of her dress. At the old woman’s cries she
laughed savagely, as did the other nurses, and repeated
her cruel action. That day the old woman was carried
away to another ward.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter13">CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class="large">CHOKING AND BEATING PATIENTS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">Miss Tillie Mayard suffered greatly from cold. One
morning she sat on the bench next to me and was livid
with the cold. Her limbs shook and her teeth chattered.
I spoke to the three attendants who sat with coats on at
the table in the center of the floor.</p>
<p class="c010">“It is cruel to lock people up and then freeze them,”
I said. They replied she had on as much as any of the
rest, and she would get no more. Just then Miss Mayard
took a fit and every patient looked frightened. Miss
Neville caught her in her arms and held her, although
the nurses roughly said:</p>
<p class="c010">“Let her fall on the floor and it will teach her
a lesson.” Miss Neville told them what she thought of
their actions, and then I got orders to make my appearance
in the office.</p>
<p class="c010">Just as I reached there Superintendent Dent came to
the door and I told him how we were suffering from the
cold, and of Miss Mayard’s condition. Doubtless, I
spoke incoherently, for I told of the state of the food,
the treatment of the nurses and their refusal to give
more clothing, the condition of Miss Mayard, and the
nurses telling us, because the asylum was a public institution,
we could not expect even kindness. Assuring
him that I needed no medical aid, I told him to go to
Miss Mayard. He did so. From Miss Neville and other
patients I learned what transpired. Miss Mayard was
still in the fit, and he caught her roughly between the
eyebrows or thereabouts, and pinched until her face was
crimson from the rush of blood to the head, and her
senses returned. All day afterward she suffered from
terrible headache, and from that on she grew worse.</p>
<p class="c010">Insane? Yes, insane; and as I watched the insanity
slowly creep over the mind that had appeared to be all right
I secretly cursed the doctors, the nurses and all public
institutions. Some one may say that she was insane at
some time previous to her consignment to the asylum.
Then if she were, was this the proper place to send a
woman just convalescing, to be given cold baths, deprived
of sufficient clothing and fed with horrible food?</p>
<p class="c010">On this morning I had a long conversation with Dr.
Ingram, the assistant superintendent of the asylum. I
found that he was kind to the helpless beings in his charge.
I began my old complaint of the cold, and he called Miss
Grady to the office and ordered more clothing given the
patients. Miss Grady said if I made a practice of telling
it would be a serious thing for me, she warned me in
time.</p>
<p class="c010">Many visitors looking for missing girls came to see me.
Miss Grady yelled in the door from the hall one day:</p>
<p class="c010">“Nellie Brown, you’re wanted.”</p>
<p class="c010">I went to the sitting-room at the end of the hall, and
there sat a gentleman who had known me intimately for
years. I saw by the sudden blanching of his face and his
inability to speak that the sight of me was wholly unexpected
and had shocked him terribly. In an instant I
determined, if he betrayed me as Nellie Bly, to say I had
never seen him before. However, I had one card to
play and I risked it. With Miss Grady within touching distance I whispered hurriedly to him, in language more
expressive than elegant:</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t give me away.”</p>
<p class="c010">I knew by the expression of his eye that he understood,
so I said to Miss Grady:</p>
<p class="c010">“I do not know this man.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you know her?” asked Miss Grady.</p>
<p class="c010">“No; this is not the young lady I came in search of,”
he replied, in a strained voice.</p>
<p class="c010">“If you do not know her you cannot stay here,” she
said, and she took him to the door. All at once a fear
struck me that he would think I had been sent there
through some mistake and would tell my friends and
make an effort to have me released. So I waited until
Miss Grady had the door unlocked. I knew that she
would have to lock it before she could leave, and the time
required to do so would give me opportunity to speak, so
I called:</p>
<p class="c010">“One moment, senor.” He returned to me and I
asked aloud:</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you speak Spanish, senor?” and then whispered,
“It’s all right. I’m after an item. Keep still.” “No,”
he said, with a peculiar emphasis, which I knew meant
that he would keep my secret.</p>
<p class="c010">People in the world can never imagine the length of
days to those in asylums. They seemed never ending,
and we welcomed any event that might give us something
to think about as well as talk of. There is nothing
to read, and the only bit of talk that never wears out is
conjuring up delicate food that they will get as soon as
they get out. Anxiously the hour was watched for when
the boat arrived to see if there were any new unfortunates
to be added to our ranks. When they came and
were ushered into the sitting-room the patients would
express sympathy to one another for them and were
anxious to show them little marks of attention. Hall
6 was the receiving hall so that was how we saw all
newcomers.</p>
<p class="c010">Soon after my advent a girl called Urena Little-Page
was brought in. She was, as she had been born, silly, and
her tender spot was, as with many sensible women, her
age. She claimed eighteen, and would grow very angry
if told to the contrary. The nurses were not long in finding
this out, and then they teased her.</p>
<p class="c010">“Urena,” said Miss Grady, “the doctors say that you
are thirty-three instead of eighteen,” and the other
nurses laughed. They kept up this until the simple
creature began to yell and cry, saying she wanted to go
home and that everybody treated her badly. After they
had gotten all the amusement out of her they wanted
and she was crying, they began to scold and tell her to
keep quiet. She grew more hysterical every moment
until they pounced upon her and slapped her face and
knocked her head in a lively fashion. This made the
poor creature cry the more, and so they choked her.
Yes, actually choked her. Then they dragged her out
to the closet, and I heard her terrified cries hush into
smothered ones. After several hours’ absence she returned
to the sitting-room, and I plainly saw the marks of
their fingers on her throat for the entire day.</p>
<p class="c010">This punishment seemed to awaken their desire to administer
more. They returned to the sitting-room and
caught hold of an old gray-haired woman whom I have
heard addressed both as Mrs. Grady and Mrs. O’Keefe.
She was insane, and she talked almost continually to herself
and to those near her. She never spoke very loud,
and at the time I speak of was sitting harmlessly chattering
to herself. They grabbed her, and my heart ached
as she cried:</p>
<p class="c010">“For God sake, ladies, don’t let them beat me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Shut up, you hussy!” said Miss Grady as she caught
the woman by her gray hair and dragged her shrieking
and pleading from the room. She was also taken to the
closet, and her cries grew lower and lower, and then
ceased.</p>
<p class="c010">The nurses returned to the room and Miss Grady remarked
that she had “settled the old fool for awhile.”
I told some of the physicians of the occurrence, but they
did not pay any attention to it.</p>
<p class="c010">One of the characters in Hall 6 was Matilda, a little
old German woman, who, I believe, went insane over the
loss of money. She was small, and had a pretty pink
complexion. She was not much trouble, except at times.
She would take spells, when she would talk into the
steam-heaters or get up on a chair and talk out of the
windows. In these conversations she railed at the lawyers
who had taken her property. The nurses seemed to
find a great deal of amusement in teasing the harmless
old soul. One day I sat beside Miss Grady and Miss
Grupe, and heard them tell her perfectly vile things to
call Miss McCarten. After telling her to say these things
they would send her to the other nurse, but Matilda
proved that she, even in her state, had more sense than
they.</p>
<p class="c010">“I cannot tell you. It is private,” was all she would
say. I saw Miss Grady, on a pretense of whispering to
her, spit in her ear. Matilda quietly wiped her ear and
said nothing.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter14">CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class="large">SOME UNFORTUNATE STORIES.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">By this time I had made the acquaintance of the
greater number of the forty-five women in hall 6. Let
me introduce a few. Louise, the pretty German girl
whom I have spoken of formerly as being sick with fever,
had the delusion that the spirits of her dead parents
were with her. “I have gotten many beatings from
Miss Grady and her assistants,” she said, “and I am unable
to eat the horrible food they give us. I ought not
to be compelled to freeze for want of proper clothing.
Oh! I pray nightly that I may be taken to my papa and
mamma. One night, when I was confined at Bellevue,
Dr. Field came; I was in bed, and weary of the examination.
At last I said: ‘I am tired of this. I will talk
no more.’ ‘Won’t you?’ he said, angrily. ‘I’ll see if I
can’t make you.’ With this he laid his crutch on the
side of the bed, and, getting up on it, he pinched me
very severely in the ribs. I jumped up straight in bed,
and said: ‘What do you mean by this?’ ‘I want to
teach you to obey when I speak to you,’ he replied. If
I could only die and go to papa!” When I left she was
confined to bed with a fever, and maybe by this time she
has her wish.</p>
<p class="c010">There is a Frenchwoman confined in hall 6, or was
during my stay, whom I firmly believe to be perfectly
sane. I watched her and talked with her every day, excepting
the last three, and I was unable to find any delusion
or mania in her. Her name is Josephine Despreau,
if that is spelled correctly, and her husband and all her
friends are in France. Josephine feels her position
keenly. Her lips tremble, and she breaks down crying
when she talks of her helpless condition. “How did you
get here?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“One morning as I was trying to get breakfast I grew
deathly sick, and two officers were called in by the woman
of the house, and I was taken to the station-house. I
was unable to understand their proceedings, and they paid
little attention to my story. Doings in this country were
new to me, and before I realized it I was lodged as an insane
woman in this asylum. When I first came I cried
that I was here without hope of release, and for crying
Miss Grady and her assistants choked me until they hurt
my throat, for it has been sore ever since.”</p>
<p class="c010">A pretty young Hebrew woman spoke so little English
I could not get her story except as told by the nurses.
They said her name is Sarah Fishbaum, and that her husband
put her in the asylum because she had a fondness
for other men than himself. Granting that Sarah was
insane, and about men, let me tell you how the nurses
tried to cure(?) her. They would call her up and say:</p>
<p class="c010">“Sarah, wouldn’t you like to have a nice young man?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, yes; a young man is all right,” Sarah would
reply in her few English words.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, Sarah, wouldn’t you like us to speak a good
word to some of the doctors for you? Wouldn’t you like
to have one of the doctors?”</p>
<p class="c010">And then they would ask her which doctor she preferred,
and advise her to make advances to him when he
visited the hall, and so on.</p>
<p class="c010">I had been watching and talking with a fair-complexioned
woman for several days, and I was at a loss to see
why she had been sent there, she was so sane.</p>
<p class="c010">“Why did you come here?” I asked her one day, after
we had indulged in a long conversation.</p>
<p class="c010">“I was sick,” she replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Are you sick mentally?” I urged.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, no; what gave you such an idea? I had been
overworking myself, and I broke down. Having some
family trouble, and being penniless and nowhere to go, I
applied to the commissioners to be sent to the poorhouse
until I would be able to go to work.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But they do not send poor people here unless they
are insane,” I said. “Don’t you know there are only insane
women, or those supposed to be so, sent here?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I knew after I got here that the majority of these
women were insane, but then I believed them when they
told me this was the place they sent all the poor who applied
for aid as I had done.”</p>
<p class="c010">“How have you been treated?” I asked. “Well, so
far I have escaped a beating, although I have been sickened
at the sight of many and the recital of more. When
I was brought here they went to give me a bath, and the
very disease for which I needed doctoring and from which
I was suffering made it necessary that I should not bathe.
But they put me in, and my sufferings were increased
greatly for weeks thereafter.”</p>
<p class="c010">A Mrs. McCartney, whose husband is a tailor, seems
perfectly rational and has not one fancy. Mary Hughes
and Mrs. Louise Schanz showed no obvious traces of insanity.</p>
<p class="c010">One day two newcomers were added to our list. The
one was an idiot, Carrie Glass, and the other was a nice-looking
German girl—quite young, she seemed, and when
she came in all the patients spoke of her nice appearance
and apparent sanity. Her name was Margaret. She told
me she had been a cook, and was extremely neat. One
day, after she had scrubbed the kitchen floor, the chambermaids
came down and deliberately soiled it. Her temper
was aroused and she began to quarrel with them; an
officer was called and she was taken to an asylum.</p>
<p class="c010">“How can they say I am insane, merely because I allowed
my temper to run away with me?” she complained.
“Other people are not shut up for crazy when they get
angry. I suppose the only thing to do is to keep quiet
and so avoid the beatings which I see others get. No one
can say one word about me. I do everything I am told,
and all the work they give me. I am obedient in every
respect, and I do everything to prove to them that I am
sane.”</p>
<p class="c010">One day an insane woman was brought in. She was
noisy, and Miss Grady gave her a beating and blacked
her eye. When the doctors noticed it and asked if it
was done before she came there the nurses said it was.</p>
<p class="c010">While I was in hall 6 I never heard the nurses address
the patients except to scold or yell at them, unless it was
to tease them. They spent much of their time gossiping
about the physicians and about the other nurses in a
manner that was not elevating. Miss Grady nearly always
interspersed her conversation with profane language,
and generally began her sentences by calling on
the name of the Lord. The names she called the patients
were of the lowest and most profane type. One
evening she quarreled with another nurse while we were
at supper about the bread, and when the nurse had gone
out she called her bad names and made ugly remarks
about her.</p>
<p class="c010">In the evenings a woman, whom I supposed to be head
cook for the doctors, used to come up and bring raisins,
grapes, apples, and crackers to the nurses. Imagine the
feelings of the hungry patients as they sat and watched
the nurses eat what was to them a dream of luxury.</p>
<p class="c010">One afternoon, Dr. Dent was talking to a patient,
Mrs. Turney, about some trouble she had had with a
nurse or matron. A short time after we were taken down
to supper and this woman who had beaten Mrs. Turney,
and of whom Dr. Dent spoke, was sitting at the door of
our dining-room. Suddenly Mrs. Turney picked up her
bowl of tea, and, rushing out of the door flung it at the
woman who had beat her. There was some loud screaming
and Mrs. Turney was returned to her place. The
next day she was transferred to the “rope gang,” which
is supposed to be composed of the most dangerous and
most suicidal women on the island.</p>
<p class="c010">At first I could not sleep and did not want to so long
as I could hear anything new. The night nurses may
have complained of the fact. At any rate one night they
came in and tried to make me take a dose of some mixture
out of a glass “to make me sleep,” they said. I told
them I would do nothing of the sort and they left me, I
hoped, for the night. My hopes were vain, for in a few
minutes they returned with a doctor, the same that received
us on our arrival. He insisted that I take it, but
I was determined not to lose my wits even for a few
hours. When he saw I was not to be coaxed he grew
rather rough, and said he had wasted too much time with
me already. That if I did not take it he would put it into
my arm with a needle. It occurred to me that if he put
it into my arm I could not get rid of it, but if I swallowed
it there was one hope, so I said I would take it. I smelt
it and it smelt like laudanum, and it was a horrible
dose. No sooner had they left the room and locked me
in than I tried to see how far down my throat my finger
would go, and the chloral was allowed to try its effect
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="c010">I want to say that the night nurse, Burns, in hall 6,
seemed very kind and patient to the poor, afflicted people.
The other nurses made several attempts to talk to
me about lovers, and asked me if I would not like to
have one. They did not find me very communicative on
the—to them—popular subject.</p>
<p class="c010">Once a week the patients are given a bath, and that is
the only time they see soap. A patient handed me a
piece of soap one day about the size of a thimble. I
considered it a great compliment in her wanting to be
kind, but I thought she would appreciate the cheap soap
more than I, so I thanked her but refused to take it. On
bathing day the tub is filled with water, and the patients
are washed, one after the other, without a change of
water. This is done until the water is really thick, and
then it is allowed to run out and the tub is refilled without
being washed. The same towels are used on all the
women, those with eruptions as well as those without.
The healthy patients fight for a change of water, but they
are compelled to submit to the dictates of the lazy, tyrannical
nurses. The dresses are seldom changed oftener
than once a month. If the patient has a visitor,
I have seen the nurses hurry her out and change her
dress before the visitor comes in. This keeps up the appearance
of careful and good management.</p>
<p class="c010">The patients who are not able to take care of themselves
get into beastly conditions, and the nurses never
look after them, but order some of the patients to do so.</p>
<p class="c010">For five days we were compelled to sit in the room all
day. I never put in such a long time. Every patient
was stiff and sore and tired. We would get in little
groups on benches and torture our stomachs by conjuring
up thoughts of what we would eat first when we got out.
If I had not known how hungry they were and the pitiful
side of it, the conversation would have been very amusing.
As it was it only made me sad. When the subject
of eating, which seemed to be the favorite one, was worn
out, they used to give their opinions of the institution
and its management. The condemnation of the nurses
and the eatables was unanimous.</p>
<p class="c010">As the days passed Miss Tillie Mayard’s condition grew
worse. She was continually cold and unable to eat of the
food provided. Day after day she sang in order to try to
maintain her memory, but at last the nurse made her
stop it. I talked with her daily, and I grieved to find her
grow worse so rapidly. At last she got a delusion. She
thought that I was trying to pass myself off for her, and
that all the people who called to see Nellie Brown were
friends in search of her, but that I, by some means, was
trying to deceive them into the belief that I was the girl.
I tried to reason with her, but found it impossible, so I
kept away from her as much as possible, lest my presence
should make her worse and feed the fancy.</p>
<p class="c010">One of the patients, Mrs. Cotter, a pretty, delicate
woman, one day thought she saw her husband coming up
the walk. She left the line in which she was marching
and ran to meet him. For this act she was sent to the
Retreat. She afterward said:</p>
<p class="c010">“The remembrance of that is enough to make me mad.
For crying the nurses beat me with a broom-handle and
jumped on me, injuring me internally, so that I shall
never get over it. Then they tied my hands and feet,
and, throwing a sheet over my head, twisted it tightly
around my throat, so I could not scream, and thus put
me in a bathtub filled with cold water. They held me
under until I gave up every hope and became senseless.
At other times they took hold of my ears and beat my
head on the floor and against the wall. Then they
pulled my hair out by the roots, so that it will never grow
in again.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Cotter here showed me proofs of her story, the
dent in the back of her head and the bare spots where
the hair had been taken out by the handful. I give her
story as plainly as possible: “My treatment was not as
bad as I have seen others get in there, but it has ruined
my health, and even if I do get out of here I will be a
wreck. When my husband heard of the treatment given
me he threatened to expose the place if I was not removed,
so I was brought here. I am well mentally now.
All that old fear has left me, and the doctor has promised
to allow my husband to take me home.”</p>
<p class="c010">I made the acquaintance of Bridget McGuinness, who
seems to be sane at the present time. She said she was
sent to Retreat 4, and put on the “rope gang.” “The
beatings I got there were something dreadful. I was
pulled around by the hair, held under the water until I
strangled, and I was choked and kicked. The nurses
would always keep a quiet patient stationed at the window
to tell them when any of the doctors were approaching.
It was hopeless to complain to the doctors, for they
always said it was the imagination of our diseased brains,
and besides we would get another beating for telling.
They would hold patients under the water and threaten
to leave them to die there if they did not promise not to
tell the doctors. We would all promise, because we knew
the doctors would not help us, and we would do anything
to escape the punishment. After breaking a window I
was transferred to the Lodge, the worst place on the
island. It is dreadfully dirty in there, and the stench
is awful. In the summer the flies swarm the place.
The food is worse than we get in other wards and we
are given only tin plates. Instead of the bars being
on the outside, as in this ward, they are on the inside.
There are many quiet patients there who have been
there for years, but the nurses keep them to do the
work. Among other beatings I got there, the nurses
jumped on me once and broke two of my ribs.</p>
<p class="c010">“While I was there a pretty young girl was brought in.
She had been sick, and she fought against being put in
that dirty place. One night the nurses took her and,
after beating her, they held her naked in a cold bath,
then they threw her on her bed. When morning came
the girl was dead. The doctors said she died of convulsions,
and that was all that was done about it.</p>
<p class="c010">“They inject so much morphine and chloral that the
patients are made crazy. I have seen the patients wild
for water from the effect of the drugs, and the nurses
would refuse it to them. I have heard women beg for a
whole night for one drop and it was not given them. I
myself cried for water until my mouth was so parched
and dry that I could not speak.”</p>
<p class="c010">I saw the same thing myself in hall 7. The patients
would beg for a drink before retiring, but the nurses—Miss
Hart and the others—refused to unlock the bathroom
that they might quench their thirst.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3 id="chapter15">CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class="large">INCIDENTS OF ASYLUM LIFE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">There is little in the wards to help one pass the time.
All the asylum clothing is made by the patients, but sewing
does not employ one’s mind. After several months’
confinement the thoughts of the busy world grow faint,
and all the poor prisoners can do is to sit and ponder over
their hopeless fate. In the upper halls a good view is obtained
of the passing boats and New York. Often I tried
to picture to myself as I looked out between the bars to
the lights faintly glimmering in the city, what my
feelings would be if I had no one to obtain my release.</p>
<p class="c010">I have watched patients stand and gaze longingly toward
the city they in all likelihood will never enter again.
It means liberty and life; it seems so near, and yet heaven
is not further from hell.</p>
<p class="c010">Do the women pine for home? Excepting the most violent
cases, they are conscious that they are confined in an
asylum. An only desire that never dies is the one for
release, for home.</p>
<p class="c010">One poor girl used to tell me every morning, “I
dreamed of my mother last night. I think she may
come to-day and take me home.” That one thought,
that longing, is always present, yet she has been confined
some four years.</p>
<p class="c010">What a mysterious thing madness is. I have watched
patients whose lips are forever sealed in a perpetual silence.
They live, breathe, eat; the human form is there,
but that something, which the body can live without,
but which cannot exist without the body, was missing. I
have wondered if behind those sealed lips there were
dreams we ken not of, or if all was blank?</p>
<p class="c010">Still, as sad are those cases when the patients are always
conversing with invisible parties, I have seen them
wholly unconscious of their surroundings and engrossed
with an invisible being. Yet, strange to say, that any
command issued to them is always obeyed, in about the
same manner as a dog obeys his master. One of the
most pitiful delusions of any of the patients was that of
a blue-eyed Irish girl, who believed she was forever
damned because of one act in her life. Her horrible
cry, morning and night, “I am damned for all eternity!”
would strike horror to my soul. Her agony seemed like
a glimpse of the inferno.</p>
<p class="c010">After being transferred to hall 7 I was locked in a
room every night with six crazy women. Two of them
seemed never to sleep, but spent the night in raving.
One would get out of her bed and creep around the room
searching for some one she wanted to kill. I could not
help but think how easy it would be for her to attack
any of the other patients confined with her. It did not
make the night more comfortable.</p>
<p class="c010">One middle-aged woman, who used to sit always in the
corner of the room, was very strangely affected. She
had a piece of newspaper, and from it she continually
read the most wonderful things I ever heard. I often
sat close by her and listened. History and romance fell
equally well from her lips.</p>
<p class="c010">I saw but one letter given a patient while I was there.
It awakened a big interest. Every patient seemed thirsty
for a word from the world, and they crowded around the
one who had been so fortunate and asked hundreds of
questions.</p>
<p class="c010">Visitors make but little interest and a great deal of
mirth. Miss Mattie Morgan, in hall 7, played for the
entertainment of some visitors one day. They were close
about her until one whispered that she was a patient.
“Crazy!” they whispered, audibly, as they fell back and
left her alone. She was amused as well as indignant over
the episode. Miss Mattie, assisted by several girls she has
trained, makes the evenings pass very pleasantly in hall 7.
They sing and dance. Often the doctors come up and
dance with the patients.</p>
<p class="c010">One day when we went down to dinner we heard a weak
little cry in the basement. Every one seemed to notice
it, and it was not long until we knew there was a baby
down there. Yes, a baby. Think of it—a little, innocent
babe born in such a chamber of horrors! I can imagine
nothing more terrible.</p>
<p class="c010">A visitor who came one day brought in her arms her
babe. A mother who had been separated from her five
little children asked permission to hold it. When the
visitor wanted to leave, the woman’s grief was uncontrollable,
as she begged to keep the babe which she imagined
was her own. It excited more patients than I had ever
seen excited before at one time.</p>
<p class="c010">The only amusement, if so it may be called, given the
patients outside, is a ride once a week, if the weather permits,
on the “merry-go-round.” It is a change, and so
they accept it with some show of pleasure.</p>
<p class="c010">A scrub-brush factory, a mat factory, and the laundry
are where the mild patients work. They get no recompense
for it, but they get hungry over it.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="chapter16">CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class="large">THE LAST GOOD-BYE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">The day Pauline Moser was brought to the asylum we
heard the most horrible screams, and an Irish girl, only
partly dressed, came staggering like a drunken person up
the hall, yelling, “Hurrah! Three cheers! I have killed
the divil! Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer,” and so on, over
and over again. Then she would pull a handful of hair
out, while she exultingly cried, “How I deceived the
divils. They always said God made hell, but he didn’t.”
Pauline helped the girl to make the place hideous by
singing the most horrible songs. After the Irish girl had
been there an hour or so, Dr. Dent came in, and as he
walked down the hall, Miss Grupe whispered to the demented
girl, “Here is the devil coming, go for him.”
Surprised that she would give a mad woman such instructions,
I fully expected to see the frenzied creature rush
at the doctor. Luckily she did not, but commenced to
repeat her refrain of “Oh, Lucifer.” After the doctor
left, Miss Grupe again tried to excite the woman by saying
the pictured minstrel on the wall was the devil, and
the poor creature began to scream, “You divil, I’ll give
it to you,” so that two nurses had to sit on her to keep
her down. The attendants seemed to find amusement
and pleasure in exciting the violent patients to do their
worst.</p>
<p class="c010">I always made a point of telling the doctors I was sane
and asking to be released, but the more I endeavored to
assure them of my sanity the more they doubted it.</p>
<p class="c010">“What are you doctors here for?” I asked one, whose
name I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="c010">“To take care of the patients and test their sanity,” he
replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very well,” I said. “There are sixteen doctors on
this island, and, excepting two, I have never seen them
pay any attention to the patients. How can a doctor
judge a woman’s sanity by merely bidding her good morning
and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the
sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer
will be that it is their imagination.” “Try every
test on me,” I have urged others, “and tell me am I
sane or insane? Try my pulse, my heart, my eyes; ask
me to stretch out my arm, to work my fingers, as Dr.
Field did at Bellevue, and then tell me if I am sane.”
They would not heed me, for they thought I raved.</p>
<p class="c010">Again I said to one, “You have no right to keep sane
people here. I am sane, have always been so and I must
insist on a thorough examination or be released. Several
of the women here are also sane. Why can’t they
be free?”</p>
<p class="c010">“They are insane,” was the reply, “and suffering from
delusions.”</p>
<p class="c010">After a long talk with Dr. Ingram, he said, “I will transfer
you to a quieter ward.” An hour later Miss Grady
called me into the hall, and, after calling me all the vile
and profane names a woman could ever remember, she
told me that it was a lucky thing for my “hide” that I
was transferred, or else she would pay me for remembering
so well to tell Dr. Ingram everything. “You d—n
hussy, you forget all about yourself, but you never forget
anything to tell the doctor.” After calling Miss Neville,
whom Dr. Ingram also kindly transferred, Miss Grady
took us to the hall above, No. 7.</p>

<p class="c010">In hall 7 there are Mrs. Kroener, Miss Fitzpatrick,
Miss Finney, and Miss Hart. I did not see as cruel treatment
as down-stairs, but I heard them make ugly remarks
and threats, twist the fingers and slap the faces of the unruly
patients. The night nurse, Conway I believe her
name is, is very cross. In hall 7, if any of the patients
possessed any modesty, they soon lost it. Every one was
compelled to undress in the hall before their own door,
and to fold their clothes and leave them there until morning.
I asked to undress in my room, but Miss Conway
told me if she ever caught me at such a trick she would
give me cause not to want to repeat it.</p>
<p class="c010">The first doctor I saw here—Dr. Caldwell—chucked
me under the chin, and as I was tired refusing to tell
where my home was, I would only speak to him in Spanish.</p>
<p class="c010">Hall 7 looks rather nice to a casual visitor. It is hung
with cheap pictures and has a piano, which is presided
over by Miss Mattie Morgan, who formerly was in a music
store in this city. She has been in the asylum for three
years. Miss Mattie has been training several of the patients
to sing, with some show of success. The artiste of
the hall is Under, pronounced Wanda, a Polish girl. She
is a gifted pianist when she chooses to display her ability.
The most difficult music she reads at a glance, and her
touch and expression are perfect.</p>
<p class="c010">On Sunday the quieter patients, whose names have been
handed in by the attendants during the week, are allowed
to go to church. A small Catholic chapel is on the island,
and other services are also held.</p>
<p class="c010">A “commissioner” came one day, and made the rounds
with Dr. Dent. In the basement they found half the
nurses gone to dinner, leaving the other half in charge
of us, as was always done. Immediately orders were
given to bring the nurses back to their duties until after
the patients had finished eating. Some of the patients
wanted to speak about their having no salt, but were prevented.</p>
<p class="c010">The insane asylum on Blackwell’s Island is a human
rat-trap. It is easy to get in, but once there it is impossible
to get out. I had intended to have myself committed
to the violent wards, the Lodge and Retreat, but
when I got the testimony of two sane women and could
give it, I decided not to risk my health—and hair—so I
did not get violent.</p>
<p class="c010">I had, toward the last, been shut off from all visitors,
and so when the lawyer, Peter A. Hendricks, came and
told me that friends of mine were willing to take charge
of me if I would rather be with them than in the asylum,
I was only too glad to give my consent. I asked him to
send me something to eat immediately on his arrival in
the city, and then I waited anxiously for my release.</p>
<p class="c010">It came sooner than I had hoped. I was out “in line”
taking a walk, and had just gotten interested in a poor
woman who had fainted away while the nurses were trying
to compel her to walk. “Good-bye; I am going home,” I
called to Pauline Moser, as she went past with a woman
on either side of her. Sadly I said farewell to all I knew
as I passed them on my way to freedom and life, while they
were left behind to a fate worse than death. “<i>Adios</i>,”
I murmured to the Mexican woman. I kissed my fingers
to her, and so I left my companions of hall 7.</p>
<p class="c010">I had looked forward so eagerly to leaving the horrible
place, yet when my release came and I knew that God’s
sunlight was to be free for me again, there was a certain
pain in leaving. For ten days I had been one of them.
Foolishly enough, it seemed intensely selfish to leave
them to their sufferings. I felt a Quixotic desire to help
them by sympathy and presence. But only for a moment.
The bars were down and freedom was sweeter to
me than ever.</p>
<p class="c010">Soon I was crossing the river and nearing New York.
Once again I was a free girl after ten days in the mad-house
on Blackwell’s Island.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3 id="chapter17">CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class="large">THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="c009">Soon after I had bidden farewell to the Blackwell’s
Island Insane Asylum, I was summoned to appear before
the Grand Jury. I answered the summons with pleasure,
because I longed to help those of God’s most unfortunate
children whom I had left prisoners behind me. If I
could not bring them that boon of all boons, liberty, I
hoped at least to influence others to make life more bearable
for them. I found the jurors to be gentlemen, and
that I need not tremble before their twenty-three august
presences.</p>
<p class="c010">I swore to the truth of my story, and then I related
all—from my start at the Temporary Home until my release.
Assistant District-Attorney Vernon M. Davis conducted
the examination. The jurors then requested
that I should accompany them on a visit to the Island.
I was glad to consent.</p>
<p class="c010">No one was expected to know of the contemplated trip
to the Island, yet we had not been there very long before
one of the commissioners of charity and Dr. MacDonald,
of Ward’s Island, were with us. One of the jurors told
me that in conversation with a man about the asylum,
he heard that they were notified of our coming an hour
before we reached the Island. This must have been done
while the Grand Jury were examining the insane pavilion
at Bellevue.</p>
<p class="c010">The trip to the island was vastly different to my first.
This time we went on a clean new boat, while the one I
had traveled in, they said, was laid up for repairs.</p>
<p class="c010">Some of the nurses were examined by the jury, and
made contradictory statements to one another, as well as
to my story. They confessed that the jury’s contemplated
visit had been talked over between them and the
doctor. Dr. Dent confessed that he had no means by
which to tell positively if the bath was cold and of the
number of women put into the same water. He knew
the food was not what it should be, but said it was due
to the lack of funds.</p>
<p class="c010">If nurses were cruel to their patients, had he any positive
means of ascertaining it? No, he had not. He said
all the doctors were not competent, which was also due
to the lack of means to secure good medical men. In
conversation with me, he said:</p>
<p class="c010">“I am glad you did this now, and had I known your
purpose, I would have aided you. We have no means of
learning the way things are going except to do as you
did. Since your story was published I found a nurse at
the Retreat who had watches set for our approach, just
as you had stated. She was dismissed.”</p>
<p class="c010">Miss Anne Neville was brought down, and I went into
the hall to meet her, knowing that the sight of so many
strange gentlemen would excite her, even if she be sane.
It was as I feared. The attendants had told her she was
going to be examined by a crowd of men, and she was
shaking with fear. Although I had left her only two
weeks before, yet she looked as if she had suffered a severe
illness, in that time, so changed was her appearance. I
asked her if she had taken any medicine, and she answered
in the affirmative. I then told her that all I
wanted her to do was tell the jury all we had done since
I was brought with her to the asylum, so they would be
convinced that I was sane. She only knew me as Miss
Nellie Brown, and was wholly ignorant of my story.</p>
<p class="c010">She was not sworn, but her story must have convinced
all hearers of the truth of my statements.</p>
<p class="c010">“When Miss Brown and I were brought here the
nurses were cruel and the food was too bad to eat. We
did not have enough clothing, and Miss Brown asked for
more all the time. I thought she was very kind, for
when a doctor promised her some clothing she said she
would give it to me. Strange to say, ever since Miss
Brown has been taken away everything is different. The
nurses are very kind and we are given plenty to wear.
The doctors come to see us often and the food is greatly
improved.”</p>
<p class="c010">Did we need more evidence?</p>
<p class="c010">The jurors then visited the kitchen. It was very clean,
and two barrels of salt stood conspicuously open near the
door! The bread on exhibition was beautifully white and
wholly unlike what was given us to eat.</p>
<p class="c010">We found the halls in the finest order. The beds were
improved, and in hall 7 the buckets in which we were
compelled to wash had been replaced by bright new
basins.</p>
<p class="c010">The institution was on exhibition, and no fault could
be found.</p>
<p class="c010">But the women I had spoken of, where were they? Not
one was to be found where I had left them. If my assertions
were not true in regard to these patients, why should
the latter be changed, so to make me unable to find them?
Miss Neville complained before the jury of being changed
several times. When we visited the hall later she was returned
to her old place.</p>
<p class="c010">Mary Hughes, of whom I had spoken as appearing
sane, was not to be found. Some relatives had taken
her away. Where, they knew not. The fair woman I
spoke of, who had been sent here because she was poor,
they said had been transferred to another island. They
denied all knowledge of the Mexican woman, and said
there never had been such a patient. Mrs. Cotter had
been discharged, and Bridget McGuinness and Rebecca
Farron had been transferred to other quarters. The German
girl, Margaret, was not to be found, and Louise had
been sent elsewhere from hall 6. The Frenchwoman,
Josephine, a great, healthy woman, they said was dying
of paralysis, and we could not see her. If I was wrong
in my judgment of these patients’ sanity, why was all
this done? I saw Tillie Mayard, and she had changed so
much for the worse that I shuddered when I looked at
her.</p>
<p class="c010">I hardly expected the grand jury to sustain me, after
they saw everything different from what it had been while
I was there. Yet they did, and their report to the court
advises all the changes made that I had proposed.</p>
<p class="c010">I have one consolation for my work—on the strength
of my story the committee of appropriation provides
$1,000,000 more than was ever before given, for the benefit
of the insane.</p>
