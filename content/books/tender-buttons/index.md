<h2 id="FOREWORD">Foreword by Gabrielle Welsh</h2>
    <p>
      I never wanted to read Gertrude Stein. I stayed far away from her. A professor in college who I considered kind and maybe even brilliant told me <i>The Making of Americans</i> (Stein’s 1925 novel) was the hardest book he’d ever read. Strike one. I’m not lazy, I’m just insecure. I’m scared of books I won’t understand, scared of feeling stupid. Then, I came out. Like, “I have a girlfriend bet you guys didn’t see this one coming” gay. (They saw it coming.) That’s when the Stein recommendations really started. I’m 21 and writing my thesis on ‘queerness,’ whatever that is. I’m writing on lesbians and literature but not the two combined, and everyone is saying, <i>Have you heard of Gertrude Stein? She was a lesbian too! </i> Strike two. But I didn’t get to three. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Fast forward and I’ve been won over. I get over my hesitations. I’m reading her poems and selections from books and I’m thinking <i>Shit, I really like this.</i> And I’m thinking <i>Oh! This is what that Broadcast album is named after, right?</i> So here we are, at <i>Tender Buttons</i> the book. I’m not too interested in giving you a full run-down or a birth to death synapsis of her life. But contextualize? I can do that. 

   In 1912 Gertrude starts writing notes and poems on small objects and events, just the normal day-to-day occurrences of Paris and the French riviera. <i>Tres bon! </i>The poems are prosey, but short, between one sentence and one paragraph. In true lesbian fashion, they read as little love letters  to Alice B. Toklas or France or modernism or the so-called avante-garde. If you find yourself next to a computer, google image search "Tender Buttons Gertrude Stein". You gotta scroll down, like far down, but you’ll find scans of the original notes and the manuscript. They look like post-it notes, like grocery lists. 
    </p>
    <p>So you’re reading these tiny snippets, six words to describe whatever she ate for dinner, and all of the sudden there are five paragraphs on CHICKEN <i>(Stick stick call then, stick stick sticking, sticking with a chicken. Sticking in a extra succession, sticking in.)</i> that you gotta read over four times. It’s so mundane and also out of this world.
    </p>
    <p>The grammar is absolutely nuts, like bananas. But the content is simple: OBJECTS, FOODS, ROOMS. No preface or explanation, just three sections that race by and leave you in the dust. OBJECTS are short and sweet, but not definitively objects. Maybe I don’t think A TIME TO EAT qualifies as an object but Gertrude writes a poem on it categorized as such I’m going to keep quiet. Then comes FOODS, my personal favorite. Longer and prose, still sectioned. CHICKEN; PASTRY; CREAM; CUCUMBER; DINNER; DINING; EATING; SALAD; SAUCE; SALMON; ORANGE; COCOA. ROOMS seems more just ROOM, sans the plural. There are no headers, just continuous thought. Like she’s walking through her house and making notes of things she sees and feels (that famous writer salon!). Then comes back and does it the next day and the next. Time is passing without narrative. 
    </p><p>
I was reading and trying to grab meaning, rearranging in my mind what each sentence could possibly mean when the words spliced together left me lost. I’m really no poet. It’s the type of book that hits you with sounds, you need to read aloud to yourself or a lover. She placed these words together and they sound like damn concerts! You’ll remember that sometimes things just need to sound good; not mean anything. You’ll see the poems. Think of when you make a poem on a fridge with letter magnets your aunt sent you in a care package. You’re missing a comma, you place a noun in the wrong spot, you don’t have the word you want so you use one that starts with the same letter. It’s beautiful. </p>
    <p>
The thing about Stein, our dear friend Gertrude, is she made a lot of things possible. Changed what language could be, and what grammar could be. Didn’t give a shit about the rules of language and lived with her boo when people really hated lesbians (though, let’s be real, they still do). I was reading another forward the other day, maybe an attempt to rev myself up to write my own. My girlfriend gave me a copy of Kathy Acker’s <i>Great Expectations</i>, which is maybe the greatest work of plagiarism. Okay, maybe I don’t have enough credibility to say that. But Eileen Myles writes the forward, 20 years after its first publishing. They are talking about Kathy but then they bounce to Gertrude, drawing (obvious) connection:

</p>

<p><i>In the grand autocratic female tradition of Gertrude Stein Kathy uses the pedestal of this novel as a lavish framing technique just like Stein used the fame she acquired from the autobiography of Alice B. Toklas to go on a book tour and tell America exactly what literature was and what culture was and what she was doing.
</i>—Acker, Kathy, and Eileen Myles. Great Expectations: A Novel.
      </p>
<p>
So what we’re all saying is Gertrude was a go-getter, and she had no problem saying exactly what she was trying to do. Maybe I can write like this, without formalities or commas and with too many run-ons because she did it first. Maybe not.<i> Tender Buttons</i> is a walk—no, a run—down exactly what Gertrude had to say. It’s a book that reminds you words are important and silly and stupid. It’s all so silly and stupid. I guess what I’m trying to say is maybe you should do the same, do exactly what you want to do.</p>

<h1>TENDER BUTTONS</h1>

<h3>
Objects &middot; Food &middot; Rooms
</h3
<hr>

<h2 id="OBJECTS">OBJECTS</h2>

<h3>A CARAFE, THAT IS A BLIND GLASS.</h3>

<p>A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a
single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All
this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference
is spreading.</p>

<h3>GLAZED GLITTER.</h3>

<p>Nickel, what is nickel, it is originally rid of a cover.</p>

<p>The change in that is that red weakens an hour. The change has
come. There is no search. But there is, there is that hope and that
interpretation and sometime, surely any is unwelcome, sometime
there is breath and there will be a sinecure and charming very
charming is that clean and cleansing. Certainly glittering is handsome
and convincing.</p>

<p>There is no gratitude in mercy and in medicine. There can be
breakages in Japanese. That is no programme. That is no color
chosen. It was chosen yesterday, that showed spitting and perhaps
washing and polishing. It certainly showed no obligation and perhaps
if borrowing is not natural there is some use in giving.</p>

<h3>A SUBSTANCE IN A CUSHION.</h3>

<p>The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference
is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.</p>

<p>Callous is something that hardening leaves behind what will be
soft if there is a genuine interest in there being present as many girls
as men. Does this change. It shows that dirt is clean when there is
a volume.</p>

<p>A cushion has that cover. Supposing you do not like to change, supposing
it is very clean that there is no change in appearance, supposing
that there is regularity and a costume is that any the worse than
an oyster and an exchange. Come to season that is there any extreme
use in feather and cotton. Is there not much more joy in a table and
more chairs and very likely roundness and a place to put them.</p>

<p>A circle of fine card board and a chance to see a tassel.</p>

<p>What is the use of a violent kind of delightfulness if there is no
pleasure in not getting tired of it. The question does not come
before there is a quotation. In any kind of place there is a top to
covering
and it is a pleasure at any rate there is some venturing in
refusing to believe nonsense. It shows what use there is in a whole
piece if one uses it and it is extreme and very likely the little things
could be dearer but in any case there is a bargain and if there is the
best thing to do is to take it away and wear it and then be reckless
be reckless and resolved on returning gratitude.</p>

<p>Light blue and the same red with purple makes a change. It shows
that there is no mistake. Any pink shows that and very likely it is
reasonable.
Very likely there should not be a finer fancy present. Some
increase means a calamity and this is the best preparation for three
and more being together. A little calm is so ordinary and in any case
there is sweetness and some of that.</p>

<p>A seal and matches and a swan and ivy and a suit.</p>

<p>A closet, a closet does not connect under the bed. The band if it
is white and black, the band has a green string. A sight a whole sight
and a little groan grinding makes a trimming such a sweet singing
trimming and a red thing not a round thing but a white thing, a red
thing and a white thing.</p>

<p>The disgrace is not in carelessness nor even in sewing it comes out
out of the way.</p>

<p>What is the sash like. The sash is not like anything mustard it is
not like a same thing that has stripes, it is not even more hurt than
that, it has a little top.</p>

<h3>A BOX.</h3>

<p>Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid
same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes
painful cattle. So then the order is that a white way of being round
is something suggesting a pin and is it disappointing, it is not, it is
so rudimentary to be analysed and see a fine substance strangely, it
is so earnest to have a green point not to red but to point again.</p>

<h3>A PIECE OF COFFEE.</h3>

<p>More of double.</p>

<p>A place in no new table.</p>

<p>A single image is not splendor. Dirty is yellow. A sign of more in
not mentioned. A piece of coffee is not a detainer. The resemblance
to yellow is dirtier and distincter. The clean mixture is whiter and
not coal color, never more coal color than altogether.</p>

<p>The sight of a reason, the same sight slighter, the sight of a simpler
negative answer, the same sore sounder, the intention to wishing, the
same splendor, the same furniture.</p>

<p>The time to show a message is when too late and later there is no
hanging in a blight.</p>

<p>A not torn rose-wood color. If it is not dangerous then a pleasure
and more than any other if it is cheap is not cheaper. The amusing
side is that the sooner there are no fewer the more certain is the
necessity dwindled. Supposing that the case contained rose-wood
and a color. Supposing that there was no reason for a distress and
more likely for a number, supposing that there was no astonishment,
is it not necessary to mingle astonishment.</p>

<p>The settling of stationing cleaning is one way not to shatter scatter
and scattering. The one way to use custom is to use soap and silk for
cleaning. The one way to see cotton is to have a design concentrating
the illusion and the illustration. The perfect way is to accustom the
thing to have a lining and the shape of a ribbon and to be solid,
quite solid in standing and to use heaviness in morning. It is light
enough in that. It has that shape nicely. Very nicely may not be
exaggerating. Very strongly may be sincerely fainting. May be
strangely flattering. May not be strange in everything. May not
be strange to.</p>

<h3>DIRT AND NOT COPPER.</h3>

<p>Dirt and not copper makes a color darker. It makes the shape so
heavy and makes no melody harder.</p>

<p>It makes mercy and relaxation and even a strength to spread a
table fuller. There are more places not empty. They see cover.</p>

<h3>NOTHING ELEGANT.</h3>

<p>A charm a single charm is doubtful. If the red is rose and there is
a gate surrounding it, if inside is let in and there places change then
certainly something is upright. It is earnest.</p>

<h3>MILDRED'S UMBRELLA.</h3>

<p>A cause and no curve, a cause and loud enough, a cause and extra
a loud clash and an extra wagon, a sign of extra, a sac a small sac
and an established color and cunning, a slender grey and no ribbon,
this means a loss a great loss a restitution.</p>

<h3>A METHOD OF A CLOAK.</h3>

<p>A single climb to a line, a straight exchange to a cane, a desperate
adventure and courage and a clock, all this which is a system, which
has feeling, which has resignation and success, all makes an attractive
black silver.</p>

<h3>A RED STAMP.</h3>

<p>If lilies are lily white if they exhaust noise and distance and even
dust, if they dusty will dirt a surface that has no extreme grace, if
they do this and it is not necessary it is not at all necessary if they
do this they need a catalogue.</p>

<h3>A BOX.</h3>

<p>A large box is handily made of what is necessary to replace any
substance. Suppose an example is necessary, the plainer it is made
the more reason there is for some outward recognition that there is
a result.</p>

<p>A box is made sometimes and them to see to see to it neatly and
to have the holes stopped up makes it necessary to use paper.</p>

<p>A custom which is necessary when a box is used and taken is that
a large part of the time there are three which have different connections.
The one is on the table. The two are on the table. The three are
on the table. The one, one is the same length as is shown by the cover
being longer. The other is different there is more cover that shows it.
The other is different and that makes the corners have the same
shade the eight are in singular arrangement to make four necessary.</p>

<p>Lax, to have corners, to be lighter than some weight, to indicate a
wedding journey, to last brown and not curious, to be wealthy, cigarettes
are established by length and by doubling.</p>

<p>Left open, to be left pounded, to be left closed, to be circulating
in summer and winter, and sick color that is grey that is not dusty
and red shows, to be sure cigarettes do measure an empty length
sooner than a choice in color.</p>

<p>Winged, to be winged means that white is yellow and pieces pieces
that are brown are dust color if dust is washed off, then it is choice
that is to say it is fitting cigarettes sooner than paper.</p>

<p>An increase why is an increase idle, why is silver cloister, why is the
spark brighter, if it is brighter is there any result, hardly more
than ever.</p>

<h3>A PLATE.</h3>

<p>An occasion for a plate, an occasional resource is in buying and
how soon does washing enable a selection of the same thing neater.
If the party is small a clever song is in order.</p>

<p>Plates and a dinner set of colored china. Pack together a string
and enough with it to protect the centre, cause a considerable haste
and gather more as it is cooling, collect more trembling and not any
even trembling, cause a whole thing to be a church.</p>

<p>A sad size a size that is not sad is blue as every bit of blue is
precocious.
A kind of green a game in green and nothing flat nothing
quite flat and more round, nothing a particular color strangely,
nothing breaking the losing of no little piece.</p>

<p>A splendid address a really splendid address is not shown by giving
a flower freely, it is not shown by a mark or by wetting.</p>

<p>Cut cut in white, cut in white so lately. Cut more than any other
and show it. Show it in the stem and in starting and in evening coming
complication.</p>

<p>A lamp is not the only sign of glass. The lamp and the cake are
not the only sign of stone. The lamp and the cake and the cover are
not the only necessity altogether.</p>

<p>A plan a hearty plan, a compressed disease and no coffee, not
even a card or a change to incline each way, a plan that has that
excess and that break is the one that shows filling.</p>

<h3>A SELTZER BOTTLE.</h3>

<p>Any neglect of many particles to a cracking, any neglect of this
makes around it what is lead in color and certainly discolor in silver.
The use of this is manifold. Supposing a certain time selected is
assured, suppose it is even necessary, suppose no other extract is
permitted and no more handling is needed, suppose the rest of the
message is mixed with a very long slender needle and even if it could
be any black border, supposing all this altogether made a dress and
suppose it was actual, suppose the mean way to state it was occasional,
if you suppose this in August and even more melodiously, if
you suppose this even in the necessary incident of there certainly
being no middle in summer and winter, suppose this and an elegant
settlement a very elegant settlement is more than of consequence, it
is not final and sufficient and substituted. This which was so kindly
a present was constant.</p>

<h3>A LONG DRESS.</h3>

<p>What is the current that makes machinery, that makes it crackle,
what is the current that presents a long line and a necessary waist.
What is this current.</p>

<p>What is the wind, what is it.</p>

<p>Where is the serene length, it is there and a dark place is not a
dark place, only a white and red are black, only a yellow and green
are blue, a pink is scarlet, a bow is every color. A line distinguishes
it. A line just distinguishes it.</p>

<h3>A RED HAT.</h3>

<p>A dark grey, a very dark grey, a quite dark grey is monstrous ordinarily,
it is so monstrous because there is no red in it. If red is in
everything it is not necessary. Is that not an argument for any use of
it and even so is there any place that is better, is there any place that
has so much stretched out.</p>

<h3>A BLUE COAT.</h3>

<p>A blue coat is guided guided away, guided and guided away, that
is the particular color that is used for that length and not any width
not even more than a shadow.</p>

<h3>A PIANO.</h3>

<p>If the speed is open, if the color is careless, if the selection of a
strong scent is not awkward, if the button holder is held by all the
waving color and there is no color, not any color. If there is no dirt
in a pin and there can be none scarcely, if there is not then the place
is the same as up standing.</p>

<p>This is no dark custom and it even is not acted in any such a way
that a restraint is not spread. That is spread, it shuts and it lifts and
awkwardly not awkwardly the centre is in standing.</p>

<h3>A CHAIR.</h3>

<p>A widow in a wise veil and more garments shows that shadows
are even. It addresses no more, it shadows the stage and learning. A
regular arrangement, the severest and the most preserved is that
which has the arrangement not more than always authorised.</p>

<p>A suitable establishment, well housed, practical, patient and staring,
a suitable bedding, very suitable and not more particularly than
complaining, anything suitable is so necessary.</p>

<p>A fact is that when the direction is just like that, no more, longer,
sudden and at the same time not any sofa, the main action is that
without a blaming there is no custody.</p>

<p>Practice measurement, practice the sign that means that really
means a necessary betrayal, in showing that there is wearing.</p>

<p>Hope, what is a spectacle, a spectacle is the resemblance between
the circular side place and nothing else, nothing else.</p>

<p>To choose it is ended, it is actual and more than that it has it
certainly has the same treat, and a seat all that is practiced and more
easily much more easily ordinarily.</p>

<p>Pick a barn, a whole barn, and bend more slender accents than
have ever been necessary, shine in the darkness necessarily.
Actually not aching, actually not aching, a stubborn bloom is so
artificial and even more than that, it is a spectacle, it is a binding
accident, it is animosity and accentuation.</p>

<p>If the chance to dirty diminishing is necessary, if it is why is there
no complexion, why is there no rubbing, why is there no special
protection.</p>

<h3>A FRIGHTFUL RELEASE.</h3>

<p>A bag which was left and not only taken but turned away was not
found. The place was shown to be very like the last time. A piece was
not exchanged, not a bit of it, a piece was left over. The rest was
mismanaged.</p>

<h3>A PURSE.</h3>

<p>A purse was not green, it was not straw color, it was hardly seen
and it had a use a long use and the chain, the chain was never missing,
it was not misplaced, it showed that it was open, that is all that
it showed.</p>

<h3>A MOUNTED UMBRELLA.</h3>

<p>What was the use of not leaving it there where it would hang what
was the use if there was no chance of ever seeing it come there and
show that it was handsome and right in the way it showed it. The lesson
is to learn that it does show it, that it shows it and that nothing,
that there is nothing, that there is no more to do about it and just so
much more is there plenty of reason for making an exchange.</p>

<h3>A CLOTH.</h3>

<p>Enough cloth is plenty and more, more is almost enough for that
and besides if there is no more spreading is there plenty of room for
it. Any occasion shows the best way.</p>

<h3>MORE.</h3>

<p>An elegant use of foliage and grace and a little piece of white
cloth and oil.</p>

<p>Wondering so winningly in several kinds of oceans is the reason
that makes red so regular and enthusiastic. The reason that there is
more snips are the same shining very colored rid of no round color.</p>

<h3>A NEW CUP AND SAUCER.</h3>

<p>Enthusiastically hurting a clouded yellow bud and saucer, enthusiastically
so is the bite in the ribbon.</p>

<p>OBJECTS.</p>

<p>Within, within the cut and slender joint alone, with sudden equals
and no more than three, two in the centre make two one side.</p>

<p>If the elbow is long and it is filled so then the best example is all
together.</p>

<p>The kind of show is made by squeezing.</p>

<h3>EYE GLASSES.</h3>

<p>A color in shaving, a saloon is well placed in the centre of an alley.</p>

<h3>CUTLET.</h3>

<p>A blind agitation is manly and uttermost.</p>

<h3>CARELESS WATER.</h3>

<p>No cup is broken in more places and mended, that is to say a plate
is broken and mending does do that it shows that culture is
Japanese. It shows the whole element of angels and orders. It does
more to choosing and it does more to that ministering counting. It
does, it does change in more water.</p>

<p>Supposing a single piece is a hair supposing more of them are
orderly, does that show that strength, does that show that joint, does
that show that balloon famously. Does it.</p>

<h3>A PAPER.</h3>

<p>A courteous occasion makes a paper show no such occasion and
this makes readiness and eyesight and likeness and a stool.</p>

<h3>A DRAWING.</h3>

<p>The meaning of this is entirely and best to say the mark, best to
say it best to show sudden places, best to make bitter, best to make
the length tall and nothing broader, anything between the half.</p>

<h3>WATER RAINING.</h3>

<p>Water astonishing and difficult altogether makes a meadow and
a stroke.</p>

<h3>COLD CLIMATE.</h3>

<p>A season in yellow sold extra strings makes lying places.</p>

<h3>MALACHITE.</h3>

<p>The sudden spoon is the same in no size. The sudden spoon is the
wound in the decision.</p>

<h3>AN UMBRELLA.</h3>

<p>Coloring high means that the strange reason is in front not more
in front behind. Not more in front in peace of the dot.</p>

<h3>A PETTICOAT.</h3>

<p>A light white, a disgrace, an ink spot, a rosy charm.</p>

<h3>A WAIST.</h3>

<p>A star glide, a single frantic sullenness, a single financial grass
greediness.</p>

<p>Object that is in wood. Hold the pine, hold the dark, hold in the
rush, make the bottom.</p>

<p>A piece of crystal. A change, in a change that is remarkable there
is no reason to say that there was a time.</p>

<p>A woolen object gilded. A country climb is the best disgrace, a
couple of practices any of them in order is so left.</p>

<h3>A TIME TO EAT.</h3>

<p>A pleasant simple habitual and tyrannical and authorised and
educated and resumed and articulate separation. This is not tardy.</p>

<h3>A LITTLE BIT OF A TUMBLER.</h3>

<p>A shining indication of yellow consists in there having been more
of the same color than could have been expected when all four were
bought. This was the hope which made the six and seven have no use
for any more places and this necessarily spread into nothing. Spread
into nothing.</p>

<h3>A FIRE.</h3>

<p>What was the use of a whole time to send and not send if there
was to be the kind of thing that made that come in. A letter was
nicely sent.</p>

<h3>A HANDKERCHIEF.</h3>

<p>A winning of all the blessings, a sample not a sample because
there is no worry.</p>

<h3>RED ROSES.</h3>

<p>A cool red rose and a pink cut pink, a collapse and a sold hole, a
little less hot.</p>

<h3>IN BETWEEN.</h3>

<p>In between a place and candy is a narrow foot-path that shows
more mounting than anything, so much really that a calling meaning
a bolster measured a whole thing with that. A virgin a whole virgin
is judged made and so between curves and outlines and real seasons
and more out glasses and a perfectly unprecedented arrangement
between old ladies and mild colds there is no satin wood shining.</p>

<h3>COLORED HATS.</h3>

<p>Colored hats are necessary to show that curls are worn by an
addition of blank spaces, this makes the difference between single
lines and broad stomachs, the least thing is lightening, the least
thing means a little flower and a big delay a big delay that makes
more nurses than little women really little women. So clean is a light
that nearly all of it shows pearls and little ways. A large hat is tall
and me and all custard whole.</p>

<h3>A FEATHER.</h3>

<p>A feather is trimmed, it is trimmed by the light and the bug and
the post, it is trimmed by little leaning and by all sorts of mounted
reserves and loud volumes. It is surely cohesive.</p>

<h3>A BROWN.</h3>

<p>A brown which is not liquid not more so is relaxed and yet there
is a change, a news is pressing.</p>

<h3>A LITTLE CALLED PAULINE.</h3>

<p>A little called anything shows shudders.</p>

<p>Come and say what prints all day. A whole few watermelon. There
is no pope.</p>

<p>No cut in pennies and little dressing and choose wide soles and
little spats really little spices.</p>

<p>A little lace makes boils. This is not true.</p>

<p>Gracious of gracious and a stamp a blue green white bow a blue
green lean, lean on the top.</p>

<p>If it is absurd then it is leadish and nearly set in where there is a
tight head.</p>

<p>A peaceful life to arise her, noon and moon and moon. A letter a
cold sleeve a blanket a shaving house and nearly the best and regular
window.</p>

<p>Nearer in fairy sea, nearer and farther, show white has lime in
sight, show a stitch of ten. Count, count more so that thicker and
thicker is leaning.</p>

<p>I hope she has her cow. Bidding a wedding, widening received
treading, little leading mention nothing.</p>

<p>Cough out cough out in the leather and really feather it is not for.</p>

<p>Please could, please could, jam it not plus more sit in when.</p>

<h3>A SOUND.</h3>

<p>Elephant beaten with candy and little pops and chews all bolts
and reckless reckless rats, this is this.</p>

<h3>A TABLE.</h3>

<p>A table means does it not my dear it means a whole steadiness. Is
it likely that a change.</p>

<p>A table means more than a glass even a looking glass is tall. A
table means necessary places and a revision a revision of a little
thing it means it does mean that there has been a stand, a stand
where it did shake.</p>

<h3>SHOES.</h3>

<p>To be a wall with a damper a stream of pounding way and nearly
enough choice makes a steady midnight. It is pus.</p>

<p>A shallow hole rose on red, a shallow hole in and in this makes ale
less. It shows shine.</p>

<h3>A DOG.</h3>

<p>A little monkey goes like a donkey that means to say that means
to say that more sighs last goes. Leave with it. A little monkey goes
like a donkey.</p>

<h3>A WHITE HUNTER.</h3>

<p>A white hunter is nearly crazy.</p>

<h3>A LEAVE.</h3>

<p>In the middle of a tiny spot and nearly bare there is a nice thing
to say that wrist is leading. Wrist is leading.</p>

<h3>SUPPOSE AN EYES.</h3>

<p>Suppose it is within a gate which open is open at the hour of closing
summer that is to say it is so.</p>

<p>All the seats are needing blackening. A white dress is in sign. A
soldier a real soldier has a worn lace a worn lace of different sizes
that is to say if he can read, if he can read he is a size to show shutting
up twenty-four.</p>

<p>Go red go red, laugh white.</p>

<p>Suppose a collapse in rubbed purr, in rubbed purr get.</p>

<p>Little sales ladies little sales ladies little saddles of mutton.</p>

<p>Little sales of leather and such beautiful beautiful, beautiful
beautiful.</p>

<h3>A SHAWL.</h3>

<p>A shawl is a hat and hurt and a red balloon and an under coat and
a sizer a sizer of talks.</p>

<p>A shawl is a wedding, a piece of wax a little build. A shawl.</p>

<p>Pick a ticket, pick it in strange steps and with hollows. There is
hollow hollow belt, a belt is a shawl.</p>

<p>A plate that has a little bobble, all of them, any so.</p>

<p>Please a round it is ticket.</p>

<p>It was a mistake to state that a laugh and a lip and a laid climb
and a depot and a cultivator and little choosing is a point it.</p>

<h3>BOOK.</h3>

<p>Book was there, it was there. Book was there. Stop it, stop it, it
was a cleaner, a wet cleaner and it was not where it was wet, it was
not high, it was directly placed back, not back again, back it was
returned, it was needless, it put a bank, a bank when, a bank care.</p>

<p>Suppose a man a realistic expression of resolute reliability suggests
pleasing itself white all white and no head does that mean
soap. It does not so. It means kind wavers and little chance to beside
beside rest. A plain.</p>

<p>Suppose ear rings, that is one way to breed, breed that. Oh chance
to say, oh nice old pole. Next best and nearest a pillar. Chest not
valuable, be papered.</p>

<p>Cover up cover up the two with a little piece of string and hope
rose and green, green.</p>

<p>Please a plate, put a match to the seam and really then really then,
really then it is a remark that joins many many lead games. It is a sister
and sister and a flower and a flower and a dog and a colored sky
a sky colored grey and nearly that nearly that let.</p>

<h3>PEELED PENCIL, CHOKE.</h3>

<p>Rub her coke.</p>

<h3>IT WAS BLACK, BLACK TOOK.</h3>

<p>Black ink best wheel bale brown.</p>

<p>Excellent not a hull house, not a pea soup, no bill no care, no precise
no past pearl pearl goat.</p>

<h3>THIS IS THE DRESS, AIDER.</h3>

<p>Aider, why aider why whow, whow stop touch, aider whow, aider
stop the muncher, muncher munchers.</p>

<h3>ROASTBEEF.</h3>

<p>In the inside there is sleeping, in the outside there is reddening, in
the morning there is meaning, in the evening there is feeling. In the
evening there is feeling. In feeling anything is resting, in feeling
anything
is mounting, in feeling there is resignation, in feeling there is
recognition, in feeling there is recurrence and entirely mistaken there
is pinching. All the standards have steamers and all the curtains
have bed linen and all the yellow has discrimination and all the circle
has circling. This makes sand.</p>

<p>Very well. Certainly the length is thinner and the rest, the round
rest has a longer summer. To shine, why not shine, to shine, to station,
to enlarge, to hurry the measure all this means nothing if there
is singing, if there is singing then there is the resumption.</p>

<p>The change the dirt, not to change dirt means that there is no
beefsteak and not to have that is no obstruction, it is so easy to
exchange meaning, it is so easy to see the difference. The difference
is that a plain resource is not entangled with thickness and it does
not mean that thickness shows such cutting, it does mean that a
meadow is useful and a cow absurd. It does not mean that there are
tears, it does not mean that exudation is cumbersome, it means no
more than a memory, a choice and a re&euml;stablishment, it means more
than any escape from a surrounding extra. All the time that there is
use there is use and any time there is a surface there is a surface, and
every time there is an exception there is an exception and every time
there is a division there is a dividing. Any time there is a surface
there is a surface and every time there is a suggestion there is a
suggestion
and every time there is silence there is silence and every time
that is languid there is that there then and not oftener, not always,
not particular, tender and changing and external and central and
surrounded and singular and simple and the same and the surface
and the circle and the shine and the succor and the white and the
same and the better and the red and the same and the centre and the
yellow and the tender and the better, and altogether.</p>

<p>Considering the circumstances there is no occasion for a reduction,
considering that there is no pealing there is no occasion
for an obligation, considering that there is no outrage there is no
necessity for any reparation, considering that there is no particle
sodden there is no occasion for deliberation. Considering everything
and which way the turn is tending, considering everything why is
there no restraint, considering everything what makes the place settle
and the plate distinguish some specialties. The whole thing is not
understood and this is not strange considering that there is no education,
this is not strange because having that certainly does show
the difference in cutting, it shows that when there is turning there is
no distress.</p>

<p>In kind, in a control, in a period, in the alteration of pigeons, in
kind cuts and thick and thin spaces, in kind ham and different colors,
the length of leaning a strong thing outside not to make a sound
but to suggest a crust, the principal taste is when there is a whole
chance to be reasonable, this does not mean that there is overtaking,
this means nothing precious, this means clearly that the chance to
exercise is a social success. So then the sound is not obtrusive.
Suppose it is obtrusive suppose it is. What is certainly the desertion
is not a reduced description, a description is not a birthday.</p>

<p>Lovely snipe and tender turn, excellent vapor and slender butter,
all the splinter and the trunk, all the poisonous darkening drunk, all
the joy in weak success, all the joyful tenderness, all the section and
the tea, all the stouter symmetry.</p>

<p>Around the size that is small, inside the stern that is the middle,
besides the remains that are praying, inside the between that is turning,
all the region is measuring and melting is exaggerating.</p>

<p>Rectangular ribbon does not mean that there is no eruption it
means that if there is no place to hold there is no place to spread.
Kindness is not earnest, it is not assiduous it is not revered.</p>

<p>Room to comb chickens and feathers and ripe purple, room to
curve single plates and large sets and second silver, room to send
everything away, room to save heat and distemper, room to search a
light that is simpler, all room has no shadow.</p>

<p>There is no use there is no use at all in smell, in taste, in teeth, in
toast, in anything, there is no use at all and the respect is mutual.</p>

<p>Why should that which is uneven, that which is resumed, that
which is tolerable why should all this resemble a smell, a thing is
there, it whistles, it is not narrower, why is there no obligation to stay
away and yet courage, courage is everywhere and the best remains
to stay.</p>

<p>If there could be that which is contained in that which is felt there
would be a chair where there are chairs and there would be no more
denial about a clatter. A clatter is not a smell. All this is good.</p>

<p>The Saturday evening which is Sunday is every week day. What
choice is there when there is a difference. A regulation is not active.
Thirstiness is not equal division.</p>

<p>Anyway, to be older and ageder is not a surfeit nor a suction, it is
not dated and careful, it is not dirty. Any little thing is clean, rubbing
is black. Why should ancient lambs be goats and young colts
and never beef, why should they, they should because there is so
much difference in age.</p>

<p>A sound, a whole sound is not separation, a whole sound is in
an order.</p>

<p>Suppose there is a pigeon, suppose there is.</p>

<p>Looseness, why is there a shadow in a kitchen, there is a shadow
in a kitchen because every little thing is bigger.</p>

<p>The time when there are four choices and there are four choices in
a difference, the time when there are four choices there is a kind and
there is a kind. There is a kind. There is a kind. Supposing there is
a bone, there is a bone. Supposing there are bones. There are bones.
When there are bones there is no supposing there are bones. There
are bones and there is that consuming. The kindly way to feel separating
is to have a space between. This shows a likeness.</p>

<p>Hope in gates, hope in spoons, hope in doors, hope in tables, no
hope in daintiness and determination. Hope in dates.</p>

<p>Tin is not a can and a stove is hardly. Tin is not necessary and neither
is a stretcher. Tin is never narrow and thick.</p>

<p>Color is in coal. Coal is outlasting roasting and a spoonful, a
whole spoon that is full is not spilling. Coal any coal is copper.</p>

<p>Claiming nothing, not claiming anything, not a claim in everything,
collecting claiming, all this makes a harmony, it even makes a
succession.</p>

<p>Sincerely gracious one morning, sincerely graciously trembling,
sincere in gracious eloping, all this makes a furnace and a blanket.
All this shows quantity.</p>

<p>Like an eye, not so much more, not any searching, no compliments.</p>

<p>Please be the beef, please beef, pleasure is not wailing. Please beef,
please be carved clear, please be a case of consideration.</p>

<p>Search a neglect. A sale, any greatness is a stall and there is no
memory, there is no clear collection.</p>

<p>A satin sight, what is a trick, no trick is mountainous and the
color, all the rush is in the blood.</p>

<p>Bargaining for a little, bargain for a touch, a liberty, an estrangement,
a characteristic turkey.</p>

<p>Please spice, please no name, place a whole weight, sink into a
standard rising, raise a circle, choose a right around, make the resonance
accounted and gather green any collar.</p>

<p>To bury a slender chicken, to raise an old feather, to surround a
garland and to bake a pole splinter, to suggest a repose and to settle
simply, to surrender one another, to succeed saving simpler, to
satisfy a singularity and not to be blinder, to sugar nothing darker
and to read redder, to have the color better, to sort out dinner, to
remain together, to surprise no sinner, to curve nothing sweeter, to
continue thinner, to increase in resting recreation to design string
not dimmer.</p>

<p>Cloudiness what is cloudiness, is it a lining, is it a roll, is it
melting.</p>

<p>The sooner there is jerking, the sooner freshness is tender, the
sooner the round it is not round the sooner it is withdrawn in cutting,
the sooner the measure means service, the sooner there is
chinking, the sooner there is sadder than salad, the sooner there is
none do her, the sooner there is no choice, the sooner there is a
gloom freer, the same sooner and more sooner, this is no error in
hurry and in pressure and in opposition to consideration.</p>

<p>A recital, what is a recital, it is an organ and use does not
strengthen valor, it soothes medicine.</p>

<p>A transfer, a large transfer, a little transfer, some transfer, clouds
and tracks do transfer, a transfer is not neglected.</p>

<p>Pride, when is there perfect pretence, there is no more than yesterday
and ordinary.</p>

<p>A sentence of a vagueness that is violence is authority and a mission
and stumbling and also certainly also a prison. Calmness, calm
is beside the plate and in way in. There is no turn in terror. There is
no volume in sound.</p>

<p>There is coagulation in cold and there is none in prudence.
Something is preserved and the evening is long and the colder spring
has sudden shadows in a sun. All the stain is tender and lilacs really
lilacs are disturbed. Why is the perfect re&euml;stablishment practiced
and prized, why is it composed. The result the pure result is juice
and size and baking and exhibition and nonchalance and sacrifice
and volume and a section in division and the surrounding recognition
and horticulture and no murmur. This is a result. There is no
superposition and circumstance, there is hardness and a reason and
the rest and remainder. There is no delight and no mathematics.</p>

<h3>MUTTON.</h3>

<p>A letter which can wither, a learning which can suffer and an outrage
which is simultaneous is principal.</p>

<p>Student, students are merciful and recognised they chew
something.</p>

<p>Hate rests that is solid and sparse and all in a shape and largely
very largely. Interleaved and successive and a sample of smell all this
makes a certainty a shade.</p>

<p>Light curls very light curls have no more curliness than soup. This
is not a subject.</p>

<p>Change a single stream of denting and change it hurriedly, what
does it express, it expresses nausea. Like a very strange likeness and
pink, like that and not more like that than the same resemblance and
not more like that than no middle space in cutting.</p>

<p>An eye glass, what is an eye glass, it is water. A splendid specimen,
what is it when it is little and tender so that there are parts. A centre
can place and four are no more and two and two are not middle.</p>

<p>Melting and not minding, safety and powder, a particular recollection
and a sincere solitude all this makes a shunning so thorough
and so unrepeated and surely if there is anything left it is a bone. It
is not solitary.</p>

<p>Any space is not quiet it is so likely to be shiny. Darkness very
dark darkness is sectional. There is a way to see in onion and surely
very surely rhubarb and a tomato, surely very surely there is that
seeding. A little thing in is a little thing.</p>

<p>Mud and water were not present and not any more of either. Silk
and stockings were not present and not any more of either. A receptacle
and a symbol and no monster were present and no more. This
made a piece show and was it a kindness, it can be asked was it a
kindness to have it warmer, was it a kindness and does gliding mean
more. Does it.</p>

<p>Does it dirty a ceiling. It does not. Is it dainty, it is if prices are
sweet. Is it lamentable, it is not if there is no undertaker. Is it
curious,
it is not when there is youth. All this makes a line, it even makes
makes no more. All this makes cherries. The reason that there is a
suggestion in vanity is due to this that there is a burst of mixed
music.</p>

<p>A temptation any temptation is an exclamation if there are misdeeds
and little bones. It is not astonishing that bones mingle as they
vary not at all and in any case why is a bone outstanding, it is so
because the circumstance that does not make a cake and character
is so easily churned and cherished.</p>

<p>Mouse and mountain and a quiver, a quaint statue and pain in an
exterior and silence more silence louder shows salmon a mischief
intender. A cake, a real salve made of mutton and liquor, a specially
retained rinsing and an established cork and blazing, this which
resignation
influences and restrains, restrains more altogether. A sign
is the specimen spoken.</p>

<p>A meal in mutton, mutton, why is lamb cheaper, it is cheaper
because so little is more. Lecture, lecture and repeat instruction.</p>

<h3>BREAKFAST.</h3>

<p>A change, a final change includes potatoes. This is no authority
for the abuse of cheese. What language can instruct any fellow.</p>

<p>A shining breakfast, a breakfast shining, no dispute, no practice,
nothing, nothing at all.</p>

<p>A sudden slice changes the whole plate, it does so suddenly.</p>

<p>An imitation, more imitation, imitation succeed imitations.</p>

<p>Anything that is decent, anything that is present, a calm and a
cook and more singularly still a shelter, all these show the need of
clamor. What is the custom, the custom is in the centre.</p>

<p>What is a loving tongue and pepper and more fish than there is
when tears many tears are necessary. The tongue and the salmon,
there is not salmon when brown is a color, there is salmon when
there is no meaning to an early morning being pleasanter. There is
no salmon, there are no tea-cups, there are the same kind of mushes
as are used as stomachers by the eating hopes that makes eggs delicious.
Drink is likely to stir a certain respect for an egg cup and more
water melon than was ever eaten yesterday. Beer is neglected and
cocoanut is famous. Coffee all coffee and a sample of soup all soup
these are the choice of a baker. A white cup means a wedding. A wet
cup means a vacation. A strong cup means an especial regulation. A
single cup means a capital arrangement between the drawer and the
place that is open.</p>

<p>Price a price is not in language, it is not in custom, it is not
in praise.</p>

<p>A colored loss, why is there no leisure. If the persecution is so
outrageous
that nothing is solemn is there any occasion for persuasion.</p>

<p>A grey turn to a top and bottom, a silent pocketful of much heating,
all the pliable succession of surrendering makes an
ingenious joy.</p>

<p>A breeze in a jar and even then silence, a special anticipation in a
rack, a gurgle a whole gurgle and more cheese than almost anything,
is this an astonishment, does this incline more than the original
division between a tray and a talking arrangement and even then a
calling into another room gently with some chicken in any way.</p>

<p>A bent way that is a way to declare that the best is all together, a
bent way shows no result, it shows a slight restraint, it shows a
necessity for retraction.</p>

<p>Suspect a single buttered flower, suspect it certainly, suspect it and
then glide, does that not alter a counting.</p>

<p>A hurt mended stick, a hurt mended cup, a hurt mended article of
exceptional relaxation and annoyance, a hurt mended, hurt and
mended is so necessary that no mistake is intended.</p>

<p>What is more likely than a roast, nothing really and yet it is never
disappointed singularly.</p>

<p>A steady cake, any steady cake is perfect and not plain, any steady
cake has a mounting reason and more than that it has singular
crusts. A season of more is a season that is instead. A season of
many is not more a season than most.</p>

<p>Take no remedy lightly, take no urging intently, take no separation
leniently, beware of no lake and no larder.</p>

<p>Burden the cracked wet soaking sack heavily, burden it so that it
is an institution in fright and in climate and in the best plan that
there can be.</p>

<p>An ordinary color, a color is that strange mixture which makes,
which does make which does not make a ripe juice, which does not
make a mat.</p>

<p>A work which is a winding a real winding of the cloaking of a
relaxing rescue. This which is so cool is not dusting, it is not dirtying
in smelling, it could use white water, it could use more extraordinarily
and in no solitude altogether. This which is so not winsome
and not widened and really not so dipped as dainty and really
dainty, very dainty, ordinarily, dainty, a dainty, not in that dainty
and dainty. If the time is determined, if it is determined and there is
reunion there is reunion with that then outline, then there is in that
a piercing shutter, all of a piercing shouter, all of a quite weather, all
of a withered exterior, all of that in most violent likely.</p>

<p>An excuse is not dreariness, a single plate is not butter, a single
weight is not excitement, a solitary crumbling is not only martial.</p>

<p>A mixed protection, very mixed with the same actual intentional
unstrangeness and riding, a single action caused necessarily is not
more a sign than a minister.</p>

<p>Seat a knife near a cage and very near a decision and more nearly
a timely working cat and scissors. Do this temporarily and make no
more mistake in standing. Spread it all and arrange the white place,
does this show in the house, does it not show in the green that is not
necessary for that color, does it not even show in the explanation
and singularly not at all stationary.</p>

<h3>SUGAR.</h3>

<p>A violent luck and a whole sample and even then quiet.</p>

<p>Water is squeezing, water is almost squeezing on lard. Water,
water is a mountain and it is selected and it is so practical that there
is no use in money. A mind under is exact and so it is necessary to
have a mouth and eye glasses.</p>

<p>A question of sudden rises and more time than awfulness is so
easy and shady. There is precisely that noise.</p>

<p>A peck a small piece not privately overseen, not at all not a slice,
not at all crestfallen and open, not at all mounting and chaining and
evenly surpassing, all the bidding comes to tea.</p>

<p>A separation is not tightly in worsted and sauce, it is so kept well
and sectionally.</p>

<p>Put it in the stew, put it to shame. A little slight shadow and a
solid fine furnace.</p>

<p>The teasing is tender and trying and thoughtful.</p>

<p>The line which sets sprinkling to be a remedy is beside the
best cold.</p>

<p>A puzzle, a monster puzzle, a heavy choking, a neglected Tuesday.</p>

<p>Wet crossing and a likeness, any likeness, a likeness has blisters, it
has that and teeth, it has the staggering blindly and a little green,
any little green is ordinary.</p>

<p>One, two and one, two, nine, second and five and that.</p>

<p>A blaze, a search in between, a cow, only any wet place, only
this tune.</p>

<p>Cut a gas jet uglier and then pierce pierce in between the next and
negligence. Choose the rate to pay and pet pet very much. A collection
of all around, a signal poison, a lack of languor and more hurts
at ease.</p>

<p>A white bird, a colored mine, a mixed orange, a dog.</p>

<p>Cuddling comes in continuing a change.</p>

<p>A piece of separate outstanding rushing is so blind with open
delicacy.</p>

<p>A canoe is orderly. A period is solemn. A cow is accepted.</p>

<p>A nice old chain is widening, it is absent, it is laid by.</p>

<h3>CRANBERRIES.</h3>

<p>Could there not be a sudden date, could there not be in the present
settlement of old age pensions, could there not be by a witness,
could there be.</p>

<p>Count the chain, cut the grass, silence the noon and murder flies.
See the basting undip the chart, see the way the kinds are best seen
from the rest, from that and untidy.</p>

<p>Cut the whole space into twenty-four spaces and then and then is
there a yellow color, there is but it is smelled, it is then put where it
is and nothing stolen.</p>

<p>A remarkable degree of red means that, a remarkable exchange
is made.</p>

<p>Climbing altogether in when there is a solid chance of soiling no
more than a dirty thing, coloring all of it in steadying is jelly.</p>

<p>Just as it is suffering, just as it is succeeded, just as it is moist so is
there no countering.</p>

<h3>MILK.</h3>

<p>A white egg and a colored pan and a cabbage showing settlement,
a constant increase.</p>

<p>A cold in a nose, a single cold nose makes an excuse. Two are
more necessary.</p>

<p>All the goods are stolen, all the blisters are in the cup.</p>

<p>Cooking, cooking is the recognition between sudden and nearly
sudden very little and all large holes.</p>

<p>A real pint, one that is open and closed and in the middle is
so bad.</p>

<p>Tender colds, seen eye holders, all work, the best of change, the
meaning, the dark red, all this and bitten, really bitten.</p>

<p>Guessing again and golfing again and the best men, the very
best men.</p>

<h3>MILK.</h3>

<p>Climb up in sight climb in the whole utter needles and a guess a
whole guess is hanging. Hanging hanging.</p>

<h3>EGGS.</h3>

<p>Kind height, kind in the right stomach with a little sudden mill.</p>

<p>Cunning shawl, cunning shawl to be steady.</p>

<p>In white in white handkerchiefs with little dots in a white belt all
shadows are singular they are singular and procured and relieved.</p>

<p>No that is not the cows shame and a precocious sound, it is a bite.</p>

<p>Cut up alone the paved way which is harm. Harm is old boat and
a likely dash.</p>

<h3>APPLE.</h3>

<p>Apple plum, carpet steak, seed clam, colored wine, calm seen,
cold cream, best shake, potato, potato and no no gold work with
pet, a green seen is called bake and change sweet is bready, a little
piece a little piece please.</p>

<p>A little piece please. Cane again to the presupposed and ready
eucalyptus tree, count out sherry and ripe plates and little corners of
a kind of ham. This is use.</p>

<h3>TAILS.</h3>

<p>Cold pails, cold with joy no joy.</p>

<p>A tiny seat that means meadows and a lapse of cuddles with
cheese and nearly bats, all this went messed. The post placed a loud
loose sprain. A rest is no better. It is better yet. All the time.</p>

<h3>LUNCH.</h3>

<p>Luck in loose plaster makes holy gauge and nearly that, nearly
more states, more states come in town light kite, blight not white.</p>

<p>A little lunch is a break in skate a little lunch so slimy, a west end
of a board line is that which shows a little beneath so that necessity
is a silk under wear. That is best wet. It is so natural, and why is
there flake, there is flake to explain exhaust.</p>

<p>A real cold hen is nervous is nervous with a towel with a spool
with real beads. It is mostly an extra sole nearly all that shaved,
shaved with an old mountain, more than that bees more than that
dinner and a bunch of likes that is to say the hearts of onions
aim less.</p>

<p>Cold coffee with a corn a corn yellow and green mass is a gem.</p>

<h3>CUPS.</h3>

<p>A single example of excellence is in the meat. A bent stick is surging
and might all might is mental. A grand clothes is searching out
a candle not that wheatly not that by more than an owl and a path.
A ham is proud of cocoanut.</p>

<p>A cup is neglected by being all in size. It is a handle and meadows
and sugar any sugar.</p>

<p>A cup is neglected by being full of size. It shows no shade, in come
little wood cuts and blessing and nearly not that not with a wild
bought in, not at all so polite, not nearly so behind.</p>

<p>Cups crane in. They need a pet oyster, they need it so hoary and
nearly choice. The best slam is utter. Nearly be freeze.</p>

<p>Why is a cup a stir and a behave. Why is it so seen.</p>

<p>A cup is readily shaded, it has in between no sense that is to say
music, memory, musical memory.</p>

<p>Peanuts blame, a half sand is holey and nearly.</p>

<h3>RHUBARB.</h3>

<p>Rhubarb is susan not susan not seat in bunch toys not wild and
laughable not in little places not in neglect and vegetable not in fold
coal age not please.</p>

<h3>SINGLE FISH.</h3>

<p>Single fish single fish single fish egg-plant single fish sight.</p>

<p>A sweet win and not less noisy than saddle and more ploughing
and nearly well painted by little things so.</p>

<p>Please shade it a play. It is necessary and beside the large sort
is puff.</p>

<p>Every way oakly, please prune it near. It is so found.</p>

<p>It is not the same.</p>

<h3>CAKE.</h3>

<p>Cake cast in went to be and needles wine needles are such.</p>

<p>This is today. A can experiment is that which makes a town,
makes a town dirty, it is little please. We came back. Two bore, bore
what, a mussed ash, ash when there is tin. This meant cake. It was
a sign.</p>

<p>Another time there was extra a hat pin sought long and this dark
made a display. The result was yellow. A caution, not a caution
to be.</p>

<p>It is no use to cause a foolish number. A blanket stretch a cloud,
a shame, all that bakery can tease, all that is beginning and yesterday
yesterday we had it met. It means some change. No some day.</p>

<p>A little leaf upon a scene an ocean any where there, a bland and
likely in the stream a recollection green land. Why white.</p>

<h3>CUSTARD.</h3>

<p>Custard is this. It has aches, aches when. Not to be. Not to be narrowly.
This makes a whole little hill.</p>

<p>It is better than a little thing that has mellow real mellow. It is
better than lakes whole lakes, it is better than seeding.</p>

<h3>POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Real potatoes cut in between.</p>

<h3>POTATOES.</h3>

<p>In the preparation of cheese, in the preparation of crackers, in the
preparation of butter, in it.</p>

<h3>ROAST POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Roast potatoes for.</p>

<h3>ASPARAGUS.</h3>

<p>Asparagus in a lean in a lean to hot. This makes it art and it is wet
wet weather wet weather wet.</p>

<h3>BUTTER.</h3>

<p>SALAD DRESSING AND AN ARTICHOKE.</p>

<p>It was please it was please carriage cup in an ice-cream, in an ice-cream
it was too bended bended with scissors and all this time. A
whole is inside a part, a part does go away, a hole is red leaf. No
choice was where there was and a second and a second.</p>

<h3>A CENTRE IN A TABLE.</h3>

<p>It was a way a day, this made some sum. Suppose a cod liver a cod
liver is an oil, suppose a cod liver oil is tunny, suppose a cod liver oil
tunny is pressed suppose a cod liver oil tunny pressed is china and
secret with a bestow a bestow reed, a reed to be a reed to be, in a reed
to be.</p>

<p>Next to me next to a folder, next to a folder some waiter, next to
a foldersome waiter and re letter and read her. Read her with her
for less.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ROOMS" id="ROOMS" />ROOMS</h2>

<p>Act so that there is no use in a centre. A wide action is not a
width. A preparation is given to the ones preparing. They do not eat
who mention silver and sweet. There was an occupation.</p>

<p>A whole centre and a border make hanging a way of dressing.
This which is not why there is a voice is the remains of an offering. There
was
no rental.</p>

<p>So the tune which is there has a little piece to play, and the exercise
is all there is of a fast. The tender and true that makes no width
to hew is the time that there is question to adopt.</p>

<p>To begin the placing there is no wagon. There is no change lighter.
It was done. And then the spreading, that was not accomplishing
that needed standing and yet the time was not so difficult as they
were not all in place. They had no change. They were not respected.
They were that, they did it so much in the matter and this showed
that that settlement was not condensed. It was spread there. Any
change was in the ends of the centre. A heap was heavy. There was
no change.</p>

<p>Burnt and behind and lifting a temporary stone and lifting more
than a drawer.</p>

<p>The instance of there being more is an instance of more. The
shadow is not shining in the way there is a black line. The truth has come.
There is a disturbance. Trusting to a baker's boy meant that
there would be very much exchanging and anyway what is the use of
a covering to a door. There is a use, they are double.</p>

<p>If the centre has the place then there is distribution. That is natural.
There is a contradiction and naturally returning there comes to
be both sides and the centre. That can be seen from the description.</p>

<p>The author of all that is in there behind the door and that is entering
in the morning. Explaining darkening and expecting relating is
all of a piece. The stove is bigger. It was of a shape that made no
audience bigger if the opening is assumed why should there not be
kneeling. Any force which is bestowed on a floor shows rubbing.
This is so nice and sweet and yet there comes the change, there
comes the time to press more air. This does not mean the same as
disappearance.</p>

<p>A little lingering lion and a Chinese chair, all the handsome
cheese which is stone, all of it and a choice, a choice of a blotter. If it
is
difficult to do it one way there is no place of similar trouble.
None. The whole arrangement is established. The end of which is
that there is a suggestion, a suggestion that there can be a different
whiteness
to a wall. This was thought.</p>

<p>A page to a corner means that the shame is no greater when the
table is longer. A glass is of any height, it is higher, it is simpler and
if it were placed there would not be any doubt.</p>

<p>Something that is an erection is that which stands and feeds and
silences a tin which is swelling. This makes no diversion that is to say
what
can please exaltation, that which is cooking.</p>

<p>A shine is that which when covered changes permission. An
enclosure blends with the same that is to say there is blending. A
blend is that which holds no mice and this is not because of a floor
it is because of nothing, it is not in a vision.</p>

<p>A fact is that when the place was replaced all was left that was
stored and all was retained that would not satisfy more than
another. The question is this, is it possible to suggest more to replace
that
thing. This question and this perfect denial does make the time change all
the
time.</p>

<p>The sister was not a mister. Was this a surprise. It was. The conclusion
came
when there was no arrangement. All the time that
there was a question there was a decision. Replacing a casual
acquaintance with an ordinary daughter does not make a son.</p>

<p>It happened in a way that the time was perfect and there was a
growth of a whole dividing time so that where formerly there was no
mistake there was no mistake now. For instance before when there
was a separation there was waiting, now when there is separation
there is the division between intending and departing. This made no
more mixture than there would be if there had been no change.</p>

<p>A little sign of an entrance is the one that made it alike. If it were
smaller
it was not alike and it was so much smaller that a table was
bigger. A table was much bigger, very much bigger. Changing that
made nothing bigger, it did not make anything bigger littler, it did
not hinder wood from not being used as leather. And this was so
charming. Harmony is so essential. Is there pleasure when there is a
passage, there is when every room is open. Every room is open when
there are not four, there were there and surely there were four, there
were two together. There is no resemblance.</p>

<p>A single speed, the reception of table linen, all the wonder of six
little spoons, there is no exercise.</p>

<p>The time came when there was a birthday. Every day was no
excitement and a birthday was added, it was added on Monday, this
made the memory clear, this which was a speech showed the chair in
the middle where there was copper.</p>

<p>Alike and a snail, this means Chinamen, it does there is no doubt
that to be right is more than perfect there is no doubt and glass is
confusing it confuses the substance which was of a color. Then came
the time for discrimination, it came then and it was never mentioned
it was so triumphant, it showed the whole head that had a hole and
should have a hole it showed the resemblance between silver.</p>

<p>Startling a starving husband is not disagreeable. The reason that
nothing is hidden is that there is no suggestion of silence. No song is
sad. A
lesson is of consequence.</p>

<p>Blind and weak and organised and worried and betrothed and
resumed and also asked to a fast and always asked to consider and
never startled and not at all bloated, this which is no rarer than
frequently
is not so astonishing when hair brushing is added. There is
quiet, there certainly is.</p>

<p>No eye-glasses are rotten, no window is useless and yet if air will
not come in there is a speech ready, there always is and there is no
dimness, not a bit of it.</p>

<p>All along the tendency to deplore the absence of more has not
been authorised. It comes to mean that with burning there is that
pleasant state of stupefication. Then there is a way of earning a living.
Who is
a man.</p>

<p>A silence is not indicated by any motion, less is indicated by a
motion, more is not indicated it is enthralled. So sullen and so low,
so much resignation, so much refusal and so much place for a lower
and an upper, so much and yet more silence, why is not sleeping a
feat why is it not and when is there some discharge when. There
never is.</p>

<p>If comparing a piece that is a size that is recognised as not a size
but a piece, comparing a piece with what is not recognised but what
is used as it is held by holding, comparing these two comes to be
repeated. Suppose they are put together, suppose that there is an
interruption, supposing that beginning again they are not changed
as to position, suppose all this and suppose that any five two of
whom are not separating suppose that the five are not consumed. Is
there an exchange, is there a resemblance to the sky which is admitted
to be there and the stars which can be seen. Is there. That was a
question. There was no certainty. Fitting a failing meant that any
two were indifferent and yet they were all connecting that, they were
all connecting that consideration. This did not determine rejoining
a letter. This did not make letters smaller. It did.</p>

<p>The stamp that is not only torn but also fitting is not any symbol.
It suggests nothing. A sack that has no opening suggests more and
the loss is not commensurate. The season gliding and the torn hangings
receiving mending all this shows an example, it shows the force
of sacrifice and likeness and disaster and a reason.</p>

<p>The time when there is not the question is only seen when there is
a shower. Any little thing is water.</p>

<p>There was a whole collection made. A damp cloth, an oyster, a
single mirror, a manikin, a student, a silent star, a single spark, a
little movement and the bed is made. This shows the disorder, it
does, it shows more likeness than anything else, it shows the single
mind that directs an apple. All the coats have a different shape, that
does not mean that they differ in color, it means a union between use
and exercise and a horse.</p>

<p>A plain hill, one is not that which is not white and red and green,
a plain hill makes no sunshine, it shows that without a disturber. So
the shape is there and the color and the outline and the miserable
centre, it is not very likely that there is a centre, a hill is a hill and
no
hill is contained in a pink tender descender.</p>

<p>A can containing a curtain is a solid sentimental usage. The trouble
in both eyes does not come from the same symmetrical carpet, it
comes from there being no more disturbance than in little paper.
This does show the teeth, it shows color.</p>

<p>A measure is that which put up so that it shows the length has a
steel construction. Tidiness is not delicacy, it does not destroy the
whole piece, certainly not it has been measured and nothing has
been cut off and even if that has been lost there is a name, no name
is signed and left over, not any space is fitted so that moving about
is plentiful. Why is there so much resignation in a package, why is
there rain, all the same the chance has come, there is no bell to ring.</p>

<p>A package and a filter and even a funnel, all this together makes
a scene and supposing the question arises is hair curly, is it dark and
dusty, supposing that question arises, is brushing necessary, is it, the
whole special suddenness commences then, there is no delusion.</p>

<p>A cape is a cover, a cape is not a cover in summer, a cape is a cover
and the regulation is that there is no such weather. A cape is not
always a cover, a cape is not a cover when there is another, there is
always something in that thing in establishing a disposition to put
wetting where it will not do more harm. There is always that disposition
and in a way there is some use in not mentioning changing
and in establishing the temperature, there is some use in it as
establishing
all that lives dimmer freer and there is no dinner in the middle
of anything. There is no such thing.</p>

<p>Why is a pale white not paler than blue, why is a connection made
by a stove, why is the example which is mentioned not shown to be
the same, why is there no adjustment between the place and the separate
attention. Why is there a choice in gamboling. Why is there no
necessary dull stable, why is there a single piece of any color, why is
there that sensible silence. Why is there the resistance in a mixture,
why is there no poster, why is there that in the window, why is there
no suggester, why is there no window, why is there no oyster closer.
Why is there a circular diminisher, why is there a bather, why is there
no scraper, why is there a dinner, why is there a bell ringer, why is
there a duster, why is there a section of a similar resemblance, why
is there that scissor.</p>

<p>South, south which is a wind is not rain, does silence choke
speech or does it not.</p>

<p>Lying in a conundrum, lying so makes the springs restless, lying
so is a reduction, not lying so is arrangeable.</p>

<p>Releasing the oldest auction that is the pleasing some still
renewing.</p>

<p>Giving it away, not giving it away, is there any difference. Giving
it away. Not giving it away.</p>

<p>Almost very likely there is no seduction, almost very likely there
is no stream, certainly very likely the height is penetrated, certainly
certainly the target is cleaned. Come to sit, come to refuse, come to
surround, come slowly and age is not lessening. The time which
showed that was when there was no eclipse. All the time that resenting
was removal all that time there was breadth. No breath is
shadowed, no breath is paintaking and yet certainly what could be
the use of paper, paper shows no disorder, it shows no desertion.</p>

<p>Why is there a difference between one window and another, why
is there a difference, because the curtain is shorter. There is no distaste
in beefsteak or in plums or in gallons of milk water, there is no
defiance in original piling up over a roof, there is no daylight in the
evening, there is none there empty.</p>

<p>A tribune, a tribune does not mean paper, it means nothing more
than cake, it means more sugar, it shows the state of lengthening any
nose. The last spice is that which shows the whole evening spent in
that sleep, it shows so that walking is an alleviation, and yet this
astonishes everybody the distance is so sprightly. In all the time
there are three days, those are not passed uselessly. Any little thing is a
change that is if nothing is wasted in that cellar. All the rest of the
chairs
are established.</p>

<p>A success, a success is alright when there are there rooms and no
vacancies, a success is alright when there is a package, success is
alright anyway and any curtain is wholesale. A curtain diminishes
and an ample space shows varnish.</p>

<p>One taste one tack, one taste one bottle, one taste one fish, one
taste one barometer. This shows no distinguishing sign when there
is a store.</p>

<p>Any smile is stern and any coat is a sample. Is there any use in
changing more doors than there are committees. This question is so
often asked that squares show that they are blotters. It is so very
agreeable to hear a voice and to see all the signs of that expression.</p>

<p>Cadences, real cadences, real cadences and a quiet color. Careful
and curved, cake and sober, all accounts and mixture, a guess at
anything is righteous, should there be a call there would be a voice.</p>

<p>A line in life, a single line and a stairway, a rigid cook, no cook
and no equator, all the same there is higher than that another evasion. Did
that
mean shame, it meant memory. Looking into a place
that was hanging and was visible looking into this place and seeing
a chair did that mean relief, it did, it certainly did not cause
constipation
and yet there is a melody that has white for a tune when there is straw
color.
This shows no face.</p>

<p>Star-light, what is star-light, star-light is a little light that is not
always
mentioned with the sun, it is mentioned with the moon and
the sun, it is mixed up with the rest of the time.</p>

<p>Why is the name changed The name is changed because in the little
space there is a tree, in some space there are no trees, in every
space there is a hint of more, all this causes the decision.</p>

<p>Why is there education, there is education because the two tables
which are folding are not tied together with a ribbon, string is used
and string being used there is a necessity for another one and
another one not being used to hearing shows no ordinary use of any
evening and yet there is no disgrace in looking, none at all. This
came to separate when there was simple selection of an entire
preoccupation.</p>

<p>A curtain, a curtain which is fastened discloses mourning, this
does not mean sparrows or elocution or even a whole preparation,
it means that there are ears and very often much more altogether.</p>

<p>Climate, climate is not southern, a little glass, a bright winter, a
strange supper an elastic tumbler, all this shows that the back is
furnished
and red which is red is a dark color. An example of this is
fifteen years and a separation of regret.</p>

<p>China is not down when there are plates, lights are not ponderous
and incalculable.</p>

<p>Currents, currents are not in the air and on the floor and in the
door and behind it first. Currents do not show it plainer. This which
is mastered has so thin a space to build it all that there is plenty of
room and yet is it quarreling, it is not and the insistence is marked.
A change is in a current and there is no habitable exercise.</p>

<p>A religion, almost a religion, any religion, a quintal in religion, a
relying and a surface and a service in indecision and a creature and
a question and a syllable in answer and more counting and no quarrel
and a single scientific statement and no darkness and no question
and an earned administration and a single set of sisters and an outline
and no blisters and the section seeing yellow and the centre
having spelling and no solitude and no quaintness and yet solid
quite so solid and the single surface centred and the question in the
placard and the singularity, is there a singularity, and the singularity,
why is there a question and the singularity why is the surface outrageous,
why is it beautiful why is it not when there is no doubt, why
is anything vacant, why is not disturbing a centre no virtue, why is it
when it is and why is it when it is and there is no doubt, there is no
doubt that the singularity shows.</p>

<p>A climate, a single climate, all the time there is a single climate,
any time there is a doubt, any time there is music that is to question
more and more and there is no politeness, there is hardly any ordeal
and certainly there is no tablecloth.</p>

<p>This is a sound and obligingness more obligingness leads to a harmony in
hesitation.</p>

<p>A lake a single lake which is a pond and a little water any water
which is an ant and no burning, not any burning, all this is sudden.</p>

<p>A canister that is the remains of furniture and a looking-glass and a
bed-room
and a larger size, all the stand is shouted and what is ancient
is practical. Should the resemblance be so that any little cover is
copied, should it be so that yards are measured, should it be so and
there be a sin, should it be so then certainly a room is big enough when it
is
so empty and the corners are gathered together.</p>

<p>The change is mercenary that settles whitening the coloring and
serving dishes where there is metal and making yellow any yellow
every color in a shade which is expressed in a tray. This is a monster
and awkward quite awkward and the little design which is flowered
which is not strange and yet has visible writing, this is not shown all
the time but at once, after that it rests where it is and where it is in
place. No change is not needed. That does show design.</p>

<p>Excellent, more excellence is borrowing and slanting very slanting
is light and secret and a recitation and emigration. Certainly shoals
are shallow and nonsense more nonsense is sullen. Very little cake is
water, very little cake has that escape.</p>

<p>Sugar any sugar, anger every anger, lover sermon lover, centre no
distractor, all order is in a measure.</p>

<p>Left over to be a lamp light, left over in victory, left over in saving,
all this and negligence and bent wood and more even much
more is not so exact as a pen and a turtle and even, certainly, and
even a piece of the same experience as more.</p>

<p>To consider a lecture, to consider it well is so anxious and so much
a charity and really supposing there is grain and if a stubble every
stubble is urgent, will there not be a chance of legality. The sound is
sickened
and the price is purchased and golden what is golden, a
clergyman, a single tax, a currency and an inner chamber.</p>

<p>Checking an emigration, checking it by smiling and certainly by
the same satisfactory stretch of hands that have more use for it than
nothing,
and mildly not mildly a correction, not mildly even a circumstance
and a sweetness and a serenity. Powder, that has no color,
if it did have would it be white.</p>

<p>A whole soldier any whole soldier has no more detail than any
case of measles.</p>

<p>A bridge a very small bridge in a location and thunder, any thunder,
this is the capture of reversible sizing and more indeed more can
be cautious. This which makes monotony careless makes it likely
that there is an exchange in principle and more than that, change in
organization.</p>

<p>This cloud does change with the movements of the moon and the
narrow the quite narrow suggestion of the building. It does and then
when it is settled and no sounds differ then comes the moment when
cheerfulness is so assured that there is an occasion.</p>

<p>A plain lap, any plain lap shows that sign, it shows that there is
not so much extension as there would be if there were more choice
in everything. And why complain of more, why complain of very
much more. Why complain at all when it is all arranged that as there
is no more opportunity and no more appeal and not even any more
clinching that certainly now some time has come.</p>

<p>A window has another spelling, it has &quot;f&quot; all together, it lacks no
more then and this is rain, this may even be something else, at any rate
there is no dedication in splendor. There is a turn of the stranger.</p>

<p>Catholic to be turned is to venture on youth and a section of
debate, it even means that no class where each one over fifty is regular is
so
stationary that there are invitations.</p>

<p>A curving example makes righteous finger-nails. This is the only
object in secretion and speech.</p>

<p>To being the same four are no more than were taller. The rest had
a big chair and a surveyance a cold accumulation of nausea, and
even more than that, they had a disappointment.</p>

<p>Nothing aiming is a flower, if flowers are abundant then they are
lilac, if they are not they are white in the centre.</p>

<p>Dance a clean dream and an extravagant turn up, secure the
steady rights and translate more than translate the authority, show
the choice and make no more mistakes than yesterday.</p>

<p>This means clearness, it means a regular notion of exercise, it
means more than that, it means liking counting, it means more than
that, it does not mean exchanging a line.</p>

<p>Why is there more craving than there is in a mountain. This does
not seem strange to one, it does not seem strange to an echo and
more surely is in there not being a habit. Why is there so much useless
suffering. Why is there.</p>

<p>Any wet weather means an open window, what is attaching eating,
anything that is violent and cooking and shows weather is the same
in the end and why is there more use in something than in all that.</p>

<p>The cases are made and books, back books are used to secure
tears and church. They are even used to exchange black slippers.
They can not be mended with wax. They show no need of any
such occasion.</p>

<p>A willow and no window, a wide place stranger, a wideness makes
an active center.</p>

<p>The sight of no pussy cat is so different that a tobacco zone is
white and cream.</p>

<p>A lilac, all a lilac and no mention of butter, not even bread and
butter, no butter and no occasion, not even a silent resemblance, not
more care than just enough haughty.</p>

<p>A safe weight is that which when it pleases is hanging. A safer
weight is one more naughty in a spectacle. The best game is that
which is shiny and scratching. Please a pease and a cracker and a
wretched use of summer.</p>

<p>Surprise, the only surprise has no occasion. It is an ingredient and
the section the whole section is one season.</p>

<p>A pecking which is petting and no worse than in the same morning
is not the only way to be continuous often.</p>

<p>A light in the moon the only light is on Sunday. What was the sensible
decision. The sensible decision was that notwithstanding many
declarations and more music, not even notwithstanding the choice
and a torch and a collection, notwithstanding the celebrating hat
and a vacation and even more noise than cutting, notwithstanding
Europe and Asia and being overbearing, not even notwithstanding
an elephant and a strict occasion, not even withstanding more cultivation
and some seasoning, not even with drowning and with the
ocean being encircling, not even with more likeness and any cloud,
not even with terrific sacrifice of pedestrianism and a special resolution,
not even more likely to be pleasing. The care with which the
rain is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the care
with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The care with
which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a
magnificent
asparagus, and also a fountain.</p>
