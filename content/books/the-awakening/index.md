  <p>Kate Chopin's 1899 novel tells the story of Edna Pontellier as she seeks to expand her life beyond the boundaries of Creole society and the restrictive expectations for wives and mothers. Called everything from "poison" to ""not altogether wholesome in its tendencies" upon publication, <i>The Awakening</i> is now recognized as a classic of feminist literature that also laid the stylistic foundation for modernist Southern fiction.</p>

    THE AWAKENING - KATE CHOPIN
  </h2>
  <section id="foreword">
    <p> Foreword </p>
    <p>My! What would Kate Chopin say if she knew her landmark novel, <i>The Awakening</i>, had become one of Cita Press’s inaugural texts! An open-access online literary resource dedicated to women’s literature seems to be a most appropriate venue for Chopin’s novel, especially when we consider how far <i>The Awakening</i> has come since it was first published in 1899, when it met with mixed reviews—reviews tending toward the highly critical. Although Chopin herself was a professional writer, an author who wrote to support her family following the untimely death of her husband, she would likely have marveled at the global reception her novel has commanded, necessitating an open-access resource to make her words available to readers around the world today and for generations to come. </p>
    <p>Considered to be shocking, immoral, and at the very least, highly unconventional, <i>The Awakening</i> faded into obscurity for most of the twentieth century. One of the less severe critical reviews claimed <i>The Awakening</i> “is not a healthy book; if it points to any particular moral or teaches any lesson, the fact is not apparent,” and worse, regarding its protagonist Edna, who “does not love her husband. The poison of passion seems to have entered her system, with her mother’s milk.”(1). The critic’s concern with the book’s “health” seems to stem from the perception of Edna’s lack of love for her husband and the direction of her passion, which appears to point outside her marriage. Ah, but what of the novel’s moral or lesson? Is it really possible that Chopin, the same author of the short story, “The Storm,” who claimed that the “firm, elastic flesh” of her protagonist, Calixta, in the arms of a momentary lover, “was knowing for the first time its birthright, was like a creamy lily that the sun invites to contribute its breath and perfume to the undying life of the world.”(2). Surely Chopin’s lesson is couched within Edna Pontellier’s passion as she awakens, body and soul. What if the necessity of passion is the lesson?  </p>
    <p>Passion’s necessity may be one of the lessons we can take from Chopin’s controversial text, but certainly it is not the only lesson. The novel emerged from obscurity like a different kind of storm: taking the literary world to new heights and awareness of what women writers could do. The late 1960s and early 1970s brought <i>The Awakening</i> into the mainstream. A time of enormous social upheaval, these years were a time of protest and reform: the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the women’s movement, and more. College students in the United States and around the western world were asking new questions about the status quo and rejecting the answers they received from the generations ahead of them. Many women—college students and otherwise—were rethinking their mothers’ choices. <i>The Awakening</i> provided a reverberating response to the calls for women’s autonomy and sexual freedom, as it provoked immediate questions about marriage, infidelity, freedom, and suicide. Scholars, students, and readers embraced the novel, as it spoke to so many women’s lived experiences. Conventional marriage, the novel seemed to say, took many forms—and love was not always a part of those forms. Love itself took many forms, and not all men were ready to reciprocate in the ways an autonomous, searching woman like Edna Pontellier needed. Women’s desire for freedom and the search for autonomy were now parts of the public discourse, though, and regardless of the outcome—for Edna, there could only be one—readers in the late twentieth century could begin to see other ways of being, of engaging the world around them, etched out in Chopin’s pages.</p>
    <p>Today, <i>The Awakening</i> is one of the most widely taught texts in the world. According to Columbia University’s Open Syllabus Project, the novel ranks within the top 100 texts among 933,000 of frequently taught books around the world. The Kate Chopin International Society (www.katechopin.org), an author society devoted to supporting Chopin’s works and related materials, boasts nearly a half a million visitors worldwide to its website every year. Clearly, even today Chopin fulfills a need among readers; she shows readers, as well as students and scholars alike, new ways of considering the world. Through Edna, she enables us to ask questions about the status quo—and to continue asking questions about it throughout our lives, because if you revisit <i>The Awakening</i> after reading it a first time, inevitably you will find new phrases, new lines, new images that beg to ask new questions that are seemingly more relevant to wherever you are in your life today. </p>
    <p>Maybe that phenomenon shouldn’t surprise us. A now-classic text should be able to adapt to the times—or to the specific times in our lives. But maybe the special quality of The Awakening is not its ability to adapt to us, but its ability to enable us to adapt to it—for surely freedom, autonomy, passion, and love are always of interest to readers. Maybe it enables us, Chopin’s readers, to keep asking the questions about being, long after Edna no longer swims in the sea of her transformation? Maybe <i>The Awakening</i>’s staying force is firmly grounded in its ability to offer the space for the questions themselves, as readers meet each new phase of their lives, well-equipped to face the unknown, just as Edna, when she swam out one last final time. Our unknowns may be less dramatic—at least for now, perhaps—but no less important and certainly no less symbolic.</p>
    <p>No doubt Kate Chopin would have been delighted, or if not at the very least, amused, by the far-reaching, long-lasting value of her novel. However, during an age in which the status quo of gender roles and power relationships is under intense scrutiny and transformation, readers of women’s literature may also see the necessity of her novel—now as urgently as the wave that carried <i>The Awakening</i> from the depths of obscurity decades ago. </p>

    THE AWAKENING
    <h2>
      <section id="1">
        I
    </h2>
    <p>
    A green and yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept repeating over and over:
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Allez vous-en! Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
    He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody
    understood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of
    the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening
    persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort,
    arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
    He walked down the gallery and across the narrow &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; which connected
    the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated before the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
    He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one
    from the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker
    rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of
    reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The
    Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted
    with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and
    bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans
    the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height
    and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and
    straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about
    him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building
    was called &ldquo;the house,&rdquo; to distinguish it from the cottages. The
    chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the
    Farival twins, were playing a duet from &ldquo;Zampa&rdquo; upon the piano. Madame
    Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy
    whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice
    to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty
    woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts
    crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a
    lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good
    many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in
    Beaudelet&rsquo;s lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the
    wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s two children were there&mdash;sturdy
    little fellows of four and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with
    a faraway, meditative air.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper
    drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was
    advancing at snail&rsquo;s pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between
    the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow
    camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the
    horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined
    shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they
    reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of
    fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning
    against a supporting post.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
    Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the
    morning seemed long to him.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;You are burnt beyond recognition,&rdquo; he added, looking at his wife as one
    looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some
    damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them
    critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them
    reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before
    leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he,
    understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into
    her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees,
    she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon
    her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the
    other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water,
    and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so amusing
    when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and
    stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to
    Klein&rsquo;s hotel and play a game of billiards.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Come go along, Lebrun,&rdquo; he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted quite
    frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.
    Pontellier.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,&rdquo; instructed
    her husband as he prepared to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Here, take the umbrella,&rdquo; she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He
    accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps
    and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Coming back to dinner?&rdquo; his wife called after him. He halted a moment and
    shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar
    bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner
    and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he found
    over at Klein&rsquo;s and the size of &ldquo;the game.&rdquo; He did not say this, but she
    understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting
    out. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.
    </p>
    <h2>
    II
    </h2>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish brown,
    about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them swiftly upon an
    object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of
    contemplation or thought.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost
    horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome
    than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness
    of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was
    engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
    Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could not
    afford cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier
    had presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
    This seemed quite proper and natural on his part. In coloring he was not
    unlike his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more
    pronounced than it would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of
    care upon his open countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the
    light and languor of the summer day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and
    began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from
    his cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around them;
    their amusing adventure out in the water&mdash;it had again assumed its
    entertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to
    the Cheniere; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the
    Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to &ldquo;The Poet and the
    Peasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
    Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not
    know any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the
    same reason. Each was interested in what the other said. Robert spoke of
    his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him. He
    was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there.
    Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New
    Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave
    him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at
    Grand Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, &ldquo;the house&rdquo; had
    been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its dozen or more
    cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the
    &ldquo;Quartier Francais,&rdquo; it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and
    comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father&rsquo;s Mississippi plantation and her
    girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country. She was an American
    woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in
    dilution. She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and
    who had engaged herself to be married. Robert was interested, and wanted
    to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like,
    and how long the mother had been dead.
    </p>
    <p>
    When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for
    the early dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;I see Leonce isn&rsquo;t coming back,&rdquo; she said, with a glance in the direction
    whence her husband had disappeared. Robert supposed he was not, as there
    were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
    When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended
    the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where, during the
    half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the little Pontellier
    children, who were very fond of him.
    </p>
    <h2>
    III
    </h2>
    <p>
    It was eleven o&rsquo;clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein&rsquo;s
    hotel. He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very talkative.
    His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep when he came
    in. He talked to her while he undressed, telling her anecdotes and bits of
    news and gossip that he had gathered during the day. From his trousers
    pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver
    coin, which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys, knife,
    handkerchief, and whatever else happened to be in his pockets. She was
    overcome with sleep, and answered him with little half utterances.
    </p>
    <p>
    He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of
    his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him,
    and valued so little his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys.
    Notwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining room
    where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were
    resting comfortably. The result of his investigation was far from
    satisfactory. He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed. One of
    them began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had a
    high fever and needed looking after. Then he lit a cigar and went and sat
    near the open door to smoke it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever. He had gone to bed
    perfectly well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day. Mr.
    Pontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken. He
    assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
    He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the
    children. If it was not a mother&rsquo;s place to look after children, whose on
    earth was it? He himself had his hands full with his brokerage business.
    He could not be in two places at once; making a living for his family on
    the street, and staying at home to see that no harm befell them. He talked
    in a monotonous, insistent way.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room. She soon
    came back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the
    pillow. She said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he
    questioned her. When his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in half
    a minute he was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. She began to cry a
    little, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir. Blowing out the
    candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare feet into
    a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch,
    where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock gently to and
    fro.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was then past midnight. The cottages were all dark. A single faint
    light gleamed out from the hallway of the house. There was no sound abroad
    except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and the
    everlasting voice of the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft hour. It
    broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night.
    </p>
    <p>
    The tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s eyes that the damp sleeve of
    her peignoir no longer served to dry them. She was holding the back of her
    chair with one hand; her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the shoulder
    of her uplifted arm. Turning, she thrust her face, steaming and wet, into
    the bend of her arm, and she went on crying there, not caring any longer
    to dry her face, her eyes, her arms. She could not have told why she was
    crying. Such experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon in her married
    life. They seemed never before to have weighed much against the abundance
    of her husband&rsquo;s kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be
    tacit and self-understood.
    </p>
    <p>
    An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar
    part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It
    was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul&rsquo;s summer day. It
    was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly
    upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her
    footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry
    all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round
    arms and nipping at her bare insteps.
    </p>
    <p>
    The little stinging, buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which
    might have held her there in the darkness half a night longer.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the
    rockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf. He was
    returning to the city to his business, and they would not see him again at
    the Island till the coming Saturday. He had regained his composure, which
    seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before. He was eager to be
    gone, as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet Street.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away
    from Klein&rsquo;s hotel the evening before. She liked money as well as most
    women, and accepted it with no little satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
    smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;ll treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,&rdquo; he laughed, as
    he prepared to kiss her good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
    The boys were tumbling about, clinging to his legs, imploring that
    numerous things be brought back to them. Mr. Pontellier was a great
    favorite, and ladies, men, children, even nurses, were always on hand to
    say goodby to him. His wife stood smiling and waving, the boys shouting,
    as he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road.
    </p>
    <p>
    A few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans. It
    was from her husband. It was filled with friandises, with luscious and
    toothsome bits&mdash;the finest of fruits, pates, a rare bottle or two,
    delicious syrups, and bonbons in abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a box;
    she was quite used to receiving them when away from home. The pates and
    fruit were brought to the dining-room; the bonbons were passed around. And
    the ladies, selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers and a little
    greedily, all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best husband in the
    world. Mrs. Pontellier was forced to admit that she knew of none better.
    </p>
    <h2>
    IV
    </h2>
    <p>
    It would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to his
    own satisfaction or any one else&rsquo;s wherein his wife failed in her duty
    toward their children. It was something which he felt rather than
    perceived, and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and
    ample atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
    If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he was
    not apt to rush crying to his mother&rsquo;s arms for comfort; he would more
    likely pick himself up, wipe the water out of his eyes and the sand out of
    his mouth, and go on playing. Tots as they were, they pulled together and
    stood their ground in childish battles with doubled fists and uplifted
    voices, which usually prevailed against the other mother-tots. The
    quadroon nurse was looked upon as a huge encumbrance, only good to button
    up waists and panties and to brush and part hair; since it seemed to be a
    law of society that hair must be parted and brushed.
    </p>
    <p>
    In short, Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman. The mother-women seemed
    to prevail that summer at Grand Isle. It was easy to know them, fluttering
    about with extended, protecting wings when any harm, real or imaginary,
    threatened their precious brood. They were women who idolized their
    children, worshiped their husbands, and esteemed it a holy privilege to
    efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as ministering angels.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many of them were delicious in the role; one of them was the embodiment of
    every womanly grace and charm. If her husband did not adore her, he was a
    brute, deserving of death by slow torture. Her name was Adele Ratignolle.
    There are no words to describe her save the old ones that have served so
    often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the fair lady of our
    dreams. There was nothing subtle or hidden about her charms; her beauty
    was all there, flaming and apparent: the spun-gold hair that comb nor
    confining pin could restrain; the blue eyes that were like nothing but
    sapphires; two lips that pouted, that were so red one could only think of
    cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in looking at them. She was
    growing a little stout, but it did not seem to detract an iota from the
    grace of every step, pose, gesture. One would not have wanted her white
    neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms more slender. Never were hands
    more exquisite than hers, and it was a joy to look at them when she
    threaded her needle or adjusted her gold thimble to her taper middle
    finger as she sewed away on the little night-drawers or fashioned a bodice
    or a bib.
    </p>
    <p>
    Madame Ratignolle was very fond of Mrs. Pontellier, and often she took her
    sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons. She was sitting
    there the afternoon of the day the box arrived from New Orleans. She had
    possession of the rocker, and she was busily engaged in sewing upon a
    diminutive pair of night-drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
    She had brought the pattern of the drawers for Mrs. Pontellier to cut out&mdash;a
    marvel of construction, fashioned to enclose a baby&rsquo;s body so effectually
    that only two small eyes might look out from the garment, like an
    Eskimo&rsquo;s. They were designed for winter wear, when treacherous drafts came
    down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found their way
    through key-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s mind was quite at rest concerning the present material
    needs of her children, and she could not see the use of anticipating and
    making winter night garments the subject of her summer meditations. But
    she did not want to appear unamiable and uninterested, so she had brought
    forth newspapers, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and
    under Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s directions she had cut a pattern of the
    impervious garment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Robert was there, seated as he had been the Sunday before, and Mrs.
    Pontellier also occupied her former position on the upper step, leaning
    listlessly against the post. Beside her was a box of bonbons, which she
    held out at intervals to Madame Ratignolle.
    </p>
    <p>
    That lady seemed at a loss to make a selection, but finally settled upon a
    stick of nougat, wondering if it were not too rich; whether it could
    possibly hurt her. Madame Ratignolle had been married seven years. About
    every two years she had a baby. At that time she had three babies, and was
    beginning to think of a fourth one. She was always talking about her
    &ldquo;condition.&rdquo; Her &ldquo;condition&rdquo; was in no way apparent, and no one would have
    known a thing about it but for her persistence in making it the subject of
    conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Robert started to reassure her, asserting that he had known a lady who had
    subsisted upon nougat during the entire&mdash;but seeing the color mount
    into Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s face he checked himself and changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mrs. Pontellier, though she had married a Creole, was not thoroughly at
    home in the society of Creoles; never before had she been thrown so
    intimately among them. There were only Creoles that summer at Lebrun&rsquo;s.
    They all knew each other, and felt like one large family, among whom
    existed the most amicable relations. A characteristic which distinguished
    them and which impressed Mrs. Pontellier most forcibly was their entire
    absence of prudery. Their freedom of expression was at first
    incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty in reconciling it
    with a lofty chastity which in the Creole woman seems to be inborn and
    unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
    Never would Edna Pontellier forget the shock with which she heard Madame
    Ratignolle relating to old Monsieur Farival the harrowing story of one of
    her accouchements, withholding no intimate detail. She was growing
    accustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting color back
    from her cheeks. Oftener than once her coming had interrupted the droll
    story with which Robert was entertaining some amused group of married
    women.
    </p>
    <p>
    A book had gone the rounds of the pension. When it came her turn to read
    it, she did so with profound astonishment. She felt moved to read the book
    in secret and solitude, though none of the others had done so,&mdash;to
    hide it from view at the sound of approaching footsteps. It was openly
    criticised and freely discussed at table. Mrs. Pontellier gave over being
    astonished, and concluded that wonders would never cease.

      <p>
        They formed a congenial group sitting there that summer afternoon&mdash;Madame
        Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a story or incident with
        much expressive gesture of her perfect hands; Robert and Mrs. Pontellier
        sitting idle, exchanging occasional words, glances or smiles which
        indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy and camaraderie.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had lived in her shadow during the past month. No one thought anything
        of it. Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to Mrs.
        Pontellier when he arrived. Since the age of fifteen, which was eleven
        years before, Robert each summer at Grand Isle had constituted himself the
        devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel. Sometimes it was a young
        girl, again a widow; but as often as not it was some interesting married
        woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        For two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle
        Duvigne&rsquo;s presence. But she died between summers; then Robert posed as an
        inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle for
        whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to vouchsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might
        look upon a faultless Madonna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?&rdquo; murmured
        Robert. &ldquo;She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. It was
        &lsquo;Robert, come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the baby
        sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where. Come and read
        Daudet to me while I sew.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Par exemple! I never had to ask. You were always there under my feet,
        like a troublesome cat.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You mean like an adoring dog. And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared on
        the scene, then it WAS like a dog. &lsquo;Passez! Adieu! Allez vous-en!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,&rdquo; she interjoined, with
        excessive naivete. That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of the
        left! The heart jealous of the soul! But for that matter, the Creole
        husband is never jealous; with him the gangrene passion is one which has
        become dwarfed by disuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his one
        time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; of sleepless nights, of
        consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge.
        While the lady at the needle kept up a little running, contemptuous
        comment:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Blagueur&mdash;farceur&mdash;gros bete, va!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier. She
        never knew precisely what to make of it; at that moment it was impossible
        for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest.
        It was understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame
        Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously. Mrs. Pontellier
        was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself. It would have
        been unacceptable and annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes
        dabbled with in an unprofessional way. She liked the dabbling. She felt in
        it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. Never had that
        lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there like
        some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching her
        splendid color.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs.
        Pontellier, that he might watch her work. She handled her brushes with a
        certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close acquaintance
        with them, but from a natural aptitude. Robert followed her work with
        close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of
        appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mais ce n&rsquo;est pas mal! Elle s&rsquo;y connait, elle a de la force, oui.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        During his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against
        Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s arm. As gently she repulsed him. Once again he repeated
        the offense. She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his
        part; yet that was no reason she should submit to it. She did not
        remonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but firmly. He offered no
        apology. The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle.
        She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her. But it
        was a fair enough piece of work, and in many respects satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so. After surveying the sketch
        critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and
        crumpled the paper between her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the
        respectful distance which they required her to observe. Mrs. Pontellier
        made them carry her paints and things into the house. She sought to detain
        them for a little talk and some pleasantry. But they were greatly in
        earnest. They had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box.
        They accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them, each holding
        out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain hope that they might be
        filled; and then away they went.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that came
        up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea. Children
        freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the oaks. Their
        voices were high and penetrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and thread
        all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely. She complained
        of faintness. Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan. She
        bathed Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s face with cologne, while Robert plied the fan
        with unnecessary vigor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering if
        there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the
        rose tint had never faded from her friend&rsquo;s face.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries
        with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess.
        Her little ones ran to meet her. Two of them clung about her white skirts,
        the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it
        along in her own fond, encircling arms. Though, as everybody well knew,
        the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin!
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going bathing?&rdquo; asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. It was not so
        much a question as a reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered, with a tone of indecision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired; I think
        not.&rdquo; Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose
        sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t miss your bath. Come on. The water
        must be delicious; it will not hurt you. Come.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the
        door, and put it on her head. They descended the steps, and walked away
        together toward the beach. The sun was low in the west and the breeze was
        soft and warm.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>
        VI
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with
        Robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second
        place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses
        which impelled her.
      </p>
      <p>
        A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,&mdash;the light
        which, showing the way, forbids it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that early period it served but to bewilder her. It moved her to
        dreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her
        the midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the
        universe as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an individual
        to the world within and about her. This may seem like a ponderous weight
        of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of twenty-eight&mdash;perhaps
        more wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased to vouchsafe to any
        woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily vague,
        tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever emerge
        from such beginning! How many souls perish in its tumult!
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring,
        murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude;
        to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is sensuous,
        enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>
        VII
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic
        hitherto contrary to her nature. Even as a child she had lived her own
        small life all within herself. At a very early period she had apprehended
        instinctively the dual life&mdash;that outward existence which conforms,
        the inward life which questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of
        reserve that had always enveloped her. There may have been&mdash;there
        must have been&mdash;influences, both subtle and apparent, working in
        their several ways to induce her to do this; but the most obvious was the
        influence of Adele Ratignolle. The excessive physical charm of the Creole
        had first attracted her, for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty.
        Then the candor of the woman&rsquo;s whole existence, which every one might
        read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own habitual reserve&mdash;this
        might have furnished a link. Who can tell what metals the gods use in
        forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy, which we might as well
        call love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm,
        under the huge white sunshade. Edna had prevailed upon Madame Ratignolle
        to leave the children behind, though she could not induce her to
        relinquish a diminutive roll of needlework, which Adele begged to be
        allowed to slip into the depths of her pocket. In some unaccountable way
        they had escaped from Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a
        long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered
        it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There were acres
        of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away still,
        vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or
        lemon trees intervening. The dark green clusters glistened from afar in
        the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing the
        more feminine and matronly figure. The charm of Edna Pontellier&rsquo;s physique
        stole insensibly upon you. The lines of her body were long, clean and
        symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into splendid poses;
        there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped fashion-plate about it. A
        casual and indiscriminating observer, in passing, might not cast a second
        glance upon the figure. But with more feeling and discernment he would
        have recognized the noble beauty of its modeling, and the graceful
        severity of poise and movement, which made Edna Pontellier different from
        the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wore a cool muslin that morning&mdash;white, with a waving vertical
        line of brown running through it; also a white linen collar and the big
        straw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door. The hat
        rested any way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy,
        and clung close to her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze veil
        about her head. She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that protected her
        wrists. She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness of ruffles that
        became her. The draperies and fluttering things which she wore suited her
        rich, luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line could not have done.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid
        construction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water.
        Each house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun&rsquo;s
        possessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential
        paraphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners might
        desire. The two women had no intention of bathing; they had just strolled
        down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the water. The
        Pontellier and Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another under the same
        roof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit. Unlocking
        the door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged, bringing a
        rug, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two huge hair
        pillows covered with crash, which she placed against the front of the
        building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by side,
        with their backs against the pillows and their feet extended. Madame
        Ratignolle removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather delicate
        handkerchief, and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried
        suspended somewhere about her person by a long, narrow ribbon. Edna
        removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat. She took the fan
        from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion. It
        was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about
        the heat, the sun, the glare. But there was a breeze blowing, a choppy,
        stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. It fluttered the skirts of
        the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting, readjusting,
        tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. A few persons were sporting
        some distance away in the water. The beach was very still of human sound
        at that hour. The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the
        porch of a neighboring bathhouse. Two young lovers were exchanging their
        hearts&rsquo; yearnings beneath the children&rsquo;s tent, which they had found
        unoccupied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest
        upon the sea. The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the
        blue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the
        horizon. A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and
        others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of whom&mdash;of what are you thinking?&rdquo; asked Adele of her companion,
        whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention,
        arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and fixed
        every feature into a statuesque repose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once: &ldquo;How
        stupid! But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to such a
        question. Let me see,&rdquo; she went on, throwing back her head and narrowing
        her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light. &ldquo;Let me see.
        I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; but perhaps I can
        retrace my thoughts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! never mind!&rdquo; laughed Madame Ratignolle. &ldquo;I am not quite so exacting.
        I will let you off this time. It is really too hot to think, especially to
        think about thinking.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But for the fun of it,&rdquo; persisted Edna. &ldquo;First of all, the sight of the
        water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue sky,
        made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at. The hot
        wind beating in my face made me think&mdash;without any connection that I
        can trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow that seemed as big as
        the ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass, which was
        higher than her waist. She threw out her arms as if swimming when she
        walked, beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water. Oh, I see
        the connection now!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the grass?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember now. I was just walking diagonally across a big field.
        My sun-bonnet obstructed the view. I could see only the stretch of green
        before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to the
        end of it. I don&rsquo;t remember whether I was frightened or pleased. I must
        have been entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Likely as not it was Sunday,&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;and I was running away from
        prayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of gloom by my
        father that chills me yet to think of.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And have you been running away from prayers ever since, ma chere?&rdquo; asked
        Madame Ratignolle, amused.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No! oh, no!&rdquo; Edna hastened to say. &ldquo;I was a little unthinking child in
        those days, just following a misleading impulse without question. On the
        contrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me;
        after I was twelve and until-until&mdash;why, I suppose until now, though
        I never thought much about it&mdash;just driven along by habit. But do you
        know,&rdquo; she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and
        leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of
        her companion, &ldquo;sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through
        the green meadow again; idly, aimlessly, unthinking and unguided.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was
        near her. Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly
        and warmly. She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand,
        murmuring in an undertone, &ldquo;Pauvre cherie.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent
        herself readily to the Creole&rsquo;s gentle caress. She was not accustomed to
        an outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or in
        others. She and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal
        through force of unfortunate habit. Her older sister, Margaret, was
        matronly and dignified, probably from having assumed matronly and
        housewifely responsibilities too early in life, their mother having died
        when they were quite young, Margaret was not effusive; she was practical.
        Edna had had an occasional girl friend, but whether accidentally or not,
        they seemed to have been all of one type&mdash;the self-contained. She
        never realized that the reserve of her own character had much, perhaps
        everything, to do with this. Her most intimate friend at school had been
        one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who wrote fine-sounding
        essays, which Edna admired and strove to imitate; and with her she talked
        and glowed over the English classics, and sometimes held religious and
        political controversies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly
        disturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her
        part. At a very early age&mdash;perhaps it was when she traversed the
        ocean of waving grass&mdash;she remembered that she had been passionately
        enamored of a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her
        father in Kentucky. She could not leave his presence when he was there,
        nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon&rsquo;s,
        with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead. But the cavalry
        officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        At another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman
        who visited a lady on a neighboring plantation. It was after they went to
        Mississippi to live. The young man was engaged to be married to the young
        lady, and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of afternoons
        in a buggy. Edna was a little miss, just merging into her teens; and the
        realization that she herself was nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged
        young man was a bitter affliction to her. But he, too, went the way of
        dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed to
        be the climax of her fate. It was when the face and figure of a great
        tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. The
        persistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. The
        hopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. Any one may
        possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or comment.
        (This was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) In the presence of
        others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as she handed the
        photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the likeness. When alone
        she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold glass passionately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her marriage to Leonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this respect
        resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of Fate.
        It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him. He fell
        in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his suit with an
        earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired. He pleased her;
        his absolute devotion flattered her. She fancied there was a sympathy of
        thought and taste between them, in which fancy she was mistaken. Add to
        this the violent opposition of her father and her sister Margaret to her
        marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no further for the motives
        which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        The acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian,
        was not for her in this world. As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped
        her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world
        of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of
        romance and dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry
        officer and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found herself
        face to face with the realities. She grew fond of her husband, realizing
        with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive
        and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby threatening its
        dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. She would
        sometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes
        forget them. The year before they had spent part of the summer with their
        grandmother Pontellier in Iberville. Feeling secure regarding their
        happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an occasional
        intense longing. Their absence was a sort of relief, though she did not
        admit this, even to herself. It seemed to free her of a responsibility
        which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not fitted her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer
        day when they sat with faces turned to the sea. But a good part of it
        escaped her. She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s shoulder.
        She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and
        the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a
        first breath of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was the sound of approaching voices. It was Robert, surrounded by a
        troop of children, searching for them. The two little Pontelliers were
        with him, and he carried Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s little girl in his arms.
        There were other children beside, and two nurse-maids followed, looking
        disagreeable and resigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax
        their muscles. Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the
        bath-house. The children all scampered off to the awning, and they stood
        there in a line, gazing upon the intruding lovers, still exchanging their
        vows and sighs. The lovers got up, with only a silent protest, and walked
        slowly away somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went
        over to join them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; she
        complained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. She leaned
        draggingly upon his arm as they walked.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>
        VIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do me a favor, Robert,&rdquo; spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost as
        soon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way. She looked up
        in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the
        umbrella which he had lifted.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Granted; as many as you like,&rdquo; he returned, glancing down into her eyes
        that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I only ask for one; let Mrs. Pontellier alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh. &ldquo;Voila que Madame
        Ratignolle est jalouse!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! I&rsquo;m in earnest; I mean what I say. Let Mrs. Pontellier alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked; himself growing serious at his companion&rsquo;s solicitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She is not one of us; she is not like us. She might make the unfortunate
        blunder of taking you seriously.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        His face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began to
        beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she take
        me seriously?&rdquo; he demanded sharply. &ldquo;Am I a comedian, a clown, a
        jack-in-the-box? Why shouldn&rsquo;t she? You Creoles! I have no patience with
        you! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme? I
        hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously. I hope she has discernment
        enough to find in me something besides the blagueur. If I thought there
        was any doubt&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, enough, Robert!&rdquo; she broke into his heated outburst. &ldquo;You are not
        thinking of what you are saying. You speak with about as little reflection
        as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the
        sand. If your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with
        any intention of being convincing, you would not be the gentleman we all
        know you to be, and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and
        daughters of the people who trust you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the
        gospel. The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! well! That isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head.
        &ldquo;You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a
        fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments? Ma
        foi!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant to have a woman tell you&mdash;&rdquo; he went on,
        unheedingly, but breaking off suddenly: &ldquo;Now if I were like Arobin-you
        remember Alcee Arobin and that story of the consul&rsquo;s wife at Biloxi?&rdquo; And
        he related the story of Alcee Arobin and the consul&rsquo;s wife; and another
        about the tenor of the French Opera, who received letters which should
        never have been written; and still other stories, grave and gay, till Mrs.
        Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously was
        apparently forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take the
        hour&rsquo;s rest which she considered helpful. Before leaving her, Robert
        begged her pardon for the impatience&mdash;he called it rudeness&mdash;with
        which he had received her well-meant caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You made one mistake, Adele,&rdquo; he said, with a light smile; &ldquo;there is no
        earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously. You
        should have warned me against taking myself seriously. Your advice might
        then have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection. Au
        revoir. But you look tired,&rdquo; he added, solicitously. &ldquo;Would you like a cup
        of bouillon? Shall I stir you a toddy? Let me mix you a toddy with a drop
        of Angostura.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and
        acceptable. He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart
        from the cottages and lying to the rear of the house. And he himself
        brought her the golden-brown bouillon, in a dainty Sevres cup, with a
        flaky cracker or two on the saucer.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open
        door, and received the cup from his hands. She told him he was a bon
        garcon, and she meant it. Robert thanked her and turned away toward &ldquo;the
        house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. They were
        leaning toward each other as the wateroaks bent from the sea. There was
        not a particle of earth beneath their feet. Their heads might have been
        turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether. The lady
        in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more jaded than
        usual. There was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the children. Robert
        scanned the distance for any such apparition. They would doubtless remain
        away till the dinner hour. The young man ascended to his mother&rsquo;s room. It
        was situated at the top of the house, made up of odd angles and a queer,
        sloping ceiling. Two broad dormer windows looked out toward the Gulf, and
        as far across it as a man&rsquo;s eye might reach. The furnishings of the room
        were light, cool, and practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. A little black
        girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the
        machine. The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided
        of imperiling her health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer
        windows. He took a book from his pocket and began energetically to read
        it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned the
        leaves. The sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room; it was
        of a ponderous, by-gone make. In the lulls, Robert and his mother
        exchanged bits of desultory conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Pontellier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Down at the beach with the children.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promised to lend her the Goncourt. Don&rsquo;t forget to take it down when
        you go; it&rsquo;s there on the bookshelf over the small table.&rdquo; Clatter,
        clatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is Victor going with the rockaway?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The rockaway? Victor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away
        somewhere.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Call him.&rdquo; Clatter, clatter!
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back
        at the wharf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t look up.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Lebrun flew to the window. She called &ldquo;Victor!&rdquo; She waved a
        handkerchief and called again. The young fellow below got into the vehicle
        and started the horse off at a gallop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. Victor was
        the younger son and brother&mdash;a tete montee, with a temper which
        invited violence and a will which no ax could break.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whenever you say the word I&rsquo;m ready to thrash any amount of reason into
        him that he&rsquo;s able to hold.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If your father had only lived!&rdquo; Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter, bang!
        It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the universe
        and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of a more
        intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been removed to other
        spheres during the early years of their married life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you hear from Montel?&rdquo; Montel was a middle-aged gentleman whose
        vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill the
        void which Monsieur Lebrun&rsquo;s taking off had left in the Lebrun household.
        Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have a letter somewhere,&rdquo; looking in the machine drawer and finding the
        letter in the bottom of the workbasket. &ldquo;He says to tell you he will be in
        Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,&rdquo;&mdash;clatter, clatter!&mdash;&ldquo;and
        if you still have the intention of joining him&rdquo;&mdash;bang! clatter,
        clatter, bang!
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me so before, mother? You know I wanted&mdash;&rdquo;
        Clatter, clatter, clatter!
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? She will be
        in late to luncheon again. She never starts to get ready for luncheon till
        the last minute.&rdquo; Clatter, clatter! &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;

        Every light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it could
        be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. The lamps were
        fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room. Some one
        had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful
        festoons between. The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened
        against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows, and which
        puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that
        swept up from the Gulf.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held
        between Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach. An
        unusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay
        over Sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their families,
        with the material help of Madame Lebrun. The dining tables had all been
        removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and in
        clusters. Each little family group had had its say and exchanged its
        domestic gossip earlier in the evening. There was now an apparent
        disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more
        general tone to the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual
        bedtime. A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor
        looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had
        brought down. The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so,
        and making their authority felt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished,
        or rather, offered. But there was nothing systematic about the programme,
        no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to
        play the piano. They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin&rsquo;s
        colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at
        their baptism. They played a duet from &ldquo;Zampa,&rdquo; and at the earnest
        solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to &ldquo;The
        Poet and the Peasant.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Allez vous-en! Sapristi!&rdquo; shrieked the parrot outside the door. He was
        the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he
        was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that
        summer. Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant
        over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and
        consigned to regions of darkness. Victor Lebrun objected; and his decrees
        were as immutable as those of Fate. The parrot fortunately offered no
        further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom of his nature
        apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that
        one impetuous outburst.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one present
        had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor. The
        mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter
        with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension. She need have had no
        apprehension. The child was mistress of the situation. She had been
        properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights.
        Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially crimped,
        stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head. Her poses were full of
        grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward
        with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there was no reason why every one should not dance. Madame Ratignolle
        could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others. She
        played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression
        into the strains which was indeed inspiring. She was keeping up her music
        on account of the children, she said; because she and her husband both
        considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to
        separate during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling
        around the room in the arms of a man. They might have danced together, but
        they did not think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The children were sent to bed. Some went submissively; others with shrieks
        and protests as they were dragged away. They had been permitted to sit up
        till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of human
        indulgence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ice-cream was passed around with cake&mdash;gold and silver cake
        arranged on platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen
        during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the
        supervision of Victor. It was pronounced a great success&mdash;excellent
        if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if
        it had been frozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept
        out of portions of it. Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about
        recommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with Robert,
        and once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and swayed like a
        reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the gallery and seated
        herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded a view of all that
        went on in the hall and could look out toward the Gulf. There was a soft
        effulgence in the east. The moon was coming up, and its mystic shimmer was
        casting a million lights across the distant, restless water.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play?&rdquo; asked Robert, coming out
        on the porch where she was. Of course Edna would like to hear Mademoiselle
        Reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her that you want to hear her. She
        likes you. She will come.&rdquo; He turned and hurried away to one of the far
        cottages, where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away. She was dragging a
        chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to the crying of
        a baby, which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put to
        sleep. She was a disagreeable little woman, no longer young, who had
        quarreled with almost every one, owing to a temper which was
        self-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others.
        Robert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        She entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance. She made an
        awkward, imperious little bow as she went in. She was a homely woman, with
        a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed. She had absolutely no
        taste in dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of
        artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play,&rdquo; she requested
        of Robert. She sat perfectly still before the piano, not touching the
        keys, while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window. A general
        air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw
        the pianist enter. There was a settling down, and a prevailing air of
        expectancy everywhere. Edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus
        signaled out for the imperious little woman&rsquo;s favor. She would not dare to
        choose, and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her
        selections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was what she herself called very fond of music. Musical strains, well
        rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. She sometimes liked
        to sit in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played or practiced.
        One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled &ldquo;Solitude.&rdquo; It was a
        short, plaintive, minor strain. The name of the piece was something else,
        but she called it &ldquo;Solitude.&rdquo; When she heard it there came before her
        imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the
        seashore. He was naked. His attitude was one of hopeless resignation as he
        looked toward a distant bird winging its flight away from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire
        gown, taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue between
        tall hedges. Again, another reminded her of children at play, and still
        another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano sent
        a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s spinal column. It was not the first
        time she had heard an artist at the piano. Perhaps it was the first time
        she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an
        impress of the abiding truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and
        blaze before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures of
        solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. But the very passions
        themselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the
        waves daily beat upon her splendid body. She trembled, she was choking,
        and the tears blinded her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle had finished. She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow, she
        went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed along
        the gallery she patted Edna upon the shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how did you like my music?&rdquo; she asked. The young woman was unable
        to answer; she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively. Mademoiselle
        Reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears. She patted her again
        upon the shoulder as she said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are the only one worth playing for. Those others? Bah!&rdquo; and she went
        shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she was mistaken about &ldquo;those others.&rdquo; Her playing had aroused a fever
        of enthusiasm. &ldquo;What passion!&rdquo; &ldquo;What an artist!&rdquo; &ldquo;I have always said no
        one could play Chopin like Mademoiselle Reisz!&rdquo; &ldquo;That last prelude! Bon
        Dieu! It shakes a man!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It was growing late, and there was a general disposition to disband. But
        some one, perhaps it was Robert, thought of a bath at that mystic hour and
        under that mystic moon.
      </p>

      <p>
        At all events Robert proposed it, and there was not a dissenting voice.
        There was not one but was ready to follow when he led the way. He did not
        lead the way, however, he directed the way; and he himself loitered behind
        with the lovers, who had betrayed a disposition to linger and hold
        themselves apart. He walked between them, whether with malicious or
        mischievous intent was not wholly clear, even to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pontelliers and Ratignolles walked ahead; the women leaning upon the
        arms of their husbands. Edna could hear Robert&rsquo;s voice behind them, and
        could sometimes hear what he said. She wondered why he did not join them.
        It was unlike him not to. Of late he had sometimes held away from her for
        an entire day, redoubling his devotion upon the next and the next, as
        though to make up for hours that had been lost. She missed him the days
        when some pretext served to take him away from her, just as one misses the
        sun on a cloudy day without having thought much about the sun when it was
        shining.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people walked in little groups toward the beach. They talked and
        laughed; some of them sang. There was a band playing down at Klein&rsquo;s
        hotel, and the strains reached them faintly, tempered by the distance.
        There were strange, rare odors abroad&mdash;a tangle of the sea smell and
        of weeds and damp, new-plowed earth, mingled with the heavy perfume of a
        field of white blossoms somewhere near. But the night sat lightly upon the
        sea and the land. There was no weight of darkness; there were no shadows.
        The white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the mystery and
        the softness of sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of them walked into the water as though into a native element. The
        sea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into
        one another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy crests
        that coiled back like slow, white serpents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna had attempted all summer to learn to swim. She had received
        instructions from both the men and women; in some instances from the
        children. Robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; and he was
        nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his
        efforts. A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water,
        unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that night she was like the little tottering, stumbling, clutching
        child, who of a sudden realizes its powers, and walks for the first time
        alone, boldly and with over-confidence. She could have shouted for joy.
        She did shout for joy, as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted her
        body to the surface of the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        A feeling of exultation overtook her, as if some power of significant
        import had been given her to control the working of her body and her soul.
        She grew daring and reckless, overestimating her strength. She wanted to
        swim far out, where no woman had swum before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her unlooked-for achievement was the subject of wonder, applause, and
        admiration. Each one congratulated himself that his special teachings had
        accomplished this desired end.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How easy it is!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she said aloud; &ldquo;why did I
        not discover before that it was nothing. Think of the time I have lost
        splashing about like a baby!&rdquo; She would not join the groups in their
        sports and bouts, but intoxicated with her newly conquered power, she swam
        out alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        She turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and
        solitude, which the vast expanse of water, meeting and melting with the
        moonlit sky, conveyed to her excited fancy. As she swam she seemed to be
        reaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once she turned and looked toward the shore, toward the people she had
        left there. She had not gone any great distance&mdash;that is, what would
        have been a great distance for an experienced swimmer. But to her
        unaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect of
        a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to overcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick vision of death smote her soul, and for a second of time appalled
        and enfeebled her senses. But by an effort she rallied her staggering
        faculties and managed to regain the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        She made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of terror,
        except to say to her husband, &ldquo;I thought I should have perished out there
        alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were not so very far, my dear; I was watching you,&rdquo; he told her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes
        and was ready to return home before the others had left the water. She
        started to walk away alone. They all called to her and shouted to her. She
        waved a dissenting hand, and went on, paying no further heed to their
        renewed cries which sought to detain her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sometimes I am tempted to think that Mrs. Pontellier is capricious,&rdquo; said
        Madame Lebrun, who was amusing herself immensely and feared that Edna&rsquo;s
        abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know she is,&rdquo; assented Mr. Pontellier; &ldquo;sometimes, not often.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna had not traversed a quarter of the distance on her way home before
        she was overtaken by Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you think I was afraid?&rdquo; she asked him, without a shade of annoyance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I knew you weren&rsquo;t afraid.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then why did you come? Why didn&rsquo;t you stay out there with the others?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I never thought of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thought of what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of anything. What difference does it make?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very tired,&rdquo; she uttered, complainingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know you are.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about it. Why should you know? I never was so
        exhausted in my life. But it isn&rsquo;t unpleasant. A thousand emotions have
        swept through me to-night. I don&rsquo;t comprehend half of them. Don&rsquo;t mind
        what I&rsquo;m saying; I am just thinking aloud. I wonder if I shall ever be
        stirred again as Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s playing moved me to-night. I wonder
        if any night on earth will ever again be like this one. It is like a night
        in a dream. The people about me are like some uncanny, half-human beings.
        There must be spirits abroad to-night.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; whispered Robert, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know this was the twenty-eighth
        of August?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The twenty-eighth of August?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. On the twenty-eighth of August, at the hour of midnight, and if the
        moon is shining&mdash;the moon must be shining&mdash;a spirit that has
        haunted these shores for ages rises up from the Gulf. With its own
        penetrating vision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him
        company, worthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the
        semi-celestials. His search has always hitherto been fruitless, and he has
        sunk back, disheartened, into the sea. But to-night he found Mrs.
        Pontellier. Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell.
        Perhaps she will never again suffer a poor, unworthy earthling to walk in
        the shadow of her divine presence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t banter me,&rdquo; she said, wounded at what appeared to be his flippancy.
        He did not mind the entreaty, but the tone with its delicate note of
        pathos was like a reproach. He could not explain; he could not tell her
        that he had penetrated her mood and understood. He said nothing except to
        offer her his arm, for, by her own admission, she was exhausted. She had
        been walking alone with her arms hanging limp, letting her white skirts
        trail along the dewy path. She took his arm, but she did not lean upon it.
        She let her hand lie listlessly, as though her thoughts were elsewhere&mdash;somewhere
        in advance of her body, and she was striving to overtake them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert assisted her into the hammock which swung from the post before her
        door out to the trunk of a tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you stay out here and wait for Mr. Pontellier?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay out here. Good-night.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I get you a pillow?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one here,&rdquo; she said, feeling about, for they were in the shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It must be soiled; the children have been tumbling it about.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; And having discovered the pillow, she adjusted it beneath her
        head. She extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of relief.
        She was not a supercilious or an over-dainty woman. She was not much given
        to reclining in the hammock, and when she did so it was with no cat-like
        suggestion of voluptuous ease, but with a beneficent repose which seemed
        to invade her whole body.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I stay with you till Mr. Pontellier comes?&rdquo; asked Robert, seating
        himself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold of the
        hammock rope which was fastened to the post.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you wish. Don&rsquo;t swing the hammock. Will you get my white shawl which I
        left on the window-sill over at the house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you chilly?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; but I shall be presently.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Presently?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Do you know what time it is? How long are you
        going to stay out here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Will you get the shawl?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; he said, rising. He went over to the house, walking
        along the grass. She watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of
        moonlight. It was past midnight. It was very quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he returned with the shawl she took it and kept it in her hand. She
        did not put it around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you say I should stay till Mr. Pontellier came back?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said you might if you wished to.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He seated himself again and rolled a cigarette, which he smoked in
        silence. Neither did Mrs. Pontellier speak. No multitude of words could
        have been more significant than those moments of silence, or more pregnant
        with the first-felt throbbings of desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the voices of the bathers were heard approaching, Robert said
        good-night. She did not answer him. He thought she was asleep. Again she
        watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he walked
        away.
      </p>

      </h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you doing out here, Edna? I thought I should find you in bed,&rdquo;
        said her husband, when he discovered her lying there. He had walked up
        with Madame Lebrun and left her at the house. His wife did not reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; he asked, bending down close to look at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Her eyes gleamed bright and intense, with no sleepy shadows, as they
        looked into his.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know it is past one o&rsquo;clock? Come on,&rdquo; and he mounted the steps
        and went into their room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edna!&rdquo; called Mr. Pontellier from within, after a few moments had gone
        by.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; she answered. He thrust his head through the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will take cold out there,&rdquo; he said, irritably. &ldquo;What folly is this?
        Why don&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t cold; I have my shawl.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The mosquitoes will devour you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are no mosquitoes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She heard him moving about the room; every sound indicating impatience and
        irritation. Another time she would have gone in at his request. She would,
        through habit, have yielded to his desire; not with any sense of
        submission or obedience to his compelling wishes, but unthinkingly, as we
        walk, move, sit, stand, go through the daily treadmill of the life which
        has been portioned out to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edna, dear, are you not coming in soon?&rdquo; he asked again, this time
        fondly, with a note of entreaty.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I am going to stay out here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is more than folly,&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t permit you to stay out
        there all night. You must come in the house instantly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        With a writhing motion she settled herself more securely in the hammock.
        She perceived that her will had blazed up, stubborn and resistant. She
        could not at that moment have done other than denied and resisted. She
        wondered if her husband had ever spoken to her like that before, and if
        she had submitted to his command. Of course she had; she remembered that
        she had. But she could not realize why or how she should have yielded,
        feeling as she then did.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Leonce, go to bed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I mean to stay out here. I don&rsquo;t wish to
        go in, and I don&rsquo;t intend to. Don&rsquo;t speak to me like that again; I shall
        not answer you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier had prepared for bed, but he slipped on an extra garment.
        He opened a bottle of wine, of which he kept a small and select supply in
        a buffet of his own. He drank a glass of the wine and went out on the
        gallery and offered a glass to his wife. She did not wish any. He drew up
        the rocker, hoisted his slippered feet on the rail, and proceeded to smoke
        a cigar. He smoked two cigars; then he went inside and drank another glass
        of wine. Mrs. Pontellier again declined to accept a glass when it was
        offered to her. Mr. Pontellier once more seated himself with elevated
        feet, and after a reasonable interval of time smoked some more cigars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna began to feel like one who awakens gradually out of a dream, a
        delicious, grotesque, impossible dream, to feel again the realities
        pressing into her soul. The physical need for sleep began to overtake her;
        the exuberance which had sustained and exalted her spirit left her
        helpless and yielding to the conditions which crowded her in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stillest hour of the night had come, the hour before dawn, when the
        world seems to hold its breath. The moon hung low, and had turned from
        silver to copper in the sleeping sky. The old owl no longer hooted, and
        the water-oaks had ceased to moan as they bent their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna arose, cramped from lying so long and still in the hammock. She
        tottered up the steps, clutching feebly at the post before passing into
        the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you coming in, Leonce?&rdquo; she asked, turning her face toward her
        husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; he answered, with a glance following a misty puff of smoke.
        &ldquo;Just as soon as I have finished my cigar.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>
        XII
      </h2>
      <p>
        She slept but a few hours. They were troubled and feverish hours,
        disturbed with dreams that were intangible, that eluded her, leaving only
        an impression upon her half-awakened senses of something unattainable. She
        was up and dressed in the cool of the early morning. The air was
        invigorating and steadied somewhat her faculties. However, she was not
        seeking refreshment or help from any source, either external or from
        within. She was blindly following whatever impulse moved her, as if she
        had placed herself in alien hands for direction, and freed her soul of
        responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep. A few,
        who intended to go over to the Cheniere for mass, were moving about. The
        lovers, who had laid their plans the night before, were already strolling
        toward the wharf. The lady in black, with her Sunday prayer-book, velvet
        and gold-clasped, and her Sunday silver beads, was following them at no
        great distance. Old Monsieur Farival was up, and was more than half
        inclined to do anything that suggested itself. He put on his big straw
        hat, and taking his umbrella from the stand in the hall, followed the lady
        in black, never overtaking her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little negro girl who worked Madame Lebrun&rsquo;s sewing-machine was
        sweeping the galleries with long, absent-minded strokes of the broom. Edna
        sent her up into the house to awaken Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell him I am going to the Cheniere. The boat is ready; tell him to
        hurry.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He had soon joined her. She had never sent for him before. She had never
        asked for him. She had never seemed to want him before. She did not appear
        conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding his presence.
        He was apparently equally unconscious of anything extraordinary in the
        situation. But his face was suffused with a quiet glow when he met her.
      </p>
      <p>
        They went together back to the kitchen to drink coffee. There was no time
        to wait for any nicety of service. They stood outside the window and the
        cook passed them their coffee and a roll, which they drank and ate from
        the window-sill. Edna said it tasted good.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had not thought of coffee nor of anything. He told her he had often
        noticed that she lacked forethought.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it enough to think of going to the Cheniere and waking you up?&rdquo;
        she laughed. &ldquo;Do I have to think of everything?&mdash;as Leonce says when
        he&rsquo;s in a bad humor. I don&rsquo;t blame him; he&rsquo;d never be in a bad humor if it
        weren&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They took a short cut across the sands. At a distance they could see the
        curious procession moving toward the wharf&mdash;the lovers, shoulder to
        shoulder, creeping; the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; old
        Monsieur Farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted
        Spanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm,
        bringing up the rear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. No one
        present understood what they said. Her name was Mariequita. She had a
        round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. Her hands were small, and
        she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. Her feet were broad
        and coarse. She did not strive to hide them. Edna looked at her feet, and
        noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beaudelet grumbled because Mariequita was there, taking up so much room.
        In reality he was annoyed at having old Monsieur Farival, who considered
        himself the better sailor of the two. But he would not quarrel with so old
        a man as Monsieur Farival, so he quarreled with Mariequita. The girl was
        deprecatory at one moment, appealing to Robert. She was saucy the next,
        moving her head up and down, making &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; at Robert and making &ldquo;mouths&rdquo;
        at Beaudelet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lovers were all alone. They saw nothing, they heard nothing. The lady
        in black was counting her beads for the third time. Old Monsieur Farival
        talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat, and of what
        Beaudelet did not know on the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna liked it all. She looked Mariequita up and down, from her ugly brown
        toes to her pretty black eyes, and back again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why does she look at me like that?&rdquo; inquired the girl of Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe she thinks you are pretty. Shall I ask her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No. Is she your sweetheart?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a married lady, and has two children.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! well! Francisco ran away with Sylvano&rsquo;s wife, who had four children.
        They took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does she understand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are those two married over there&mdash;leaning on each other?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; laughed Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; echoed Mariequita, with a serious, confirmatory bob of
        the head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sun was high up and beginning to bite. The swift breeze seemed to Edna
        to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands. Robert held
        his umbrella over her. As they went cutting sidewise through the water,
        the sails bellied taut, with the wind filling and overflowing them. Old
        Monsieur Farival laughed sardonically at something as he looked at the
        sails, and Beaudelet swore at the old man under his breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailing across the bay to the Cheniere Caminada, Edna felt as if she were
        being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast, whose chains
        had been loosening&mdash;had snapped the night before when the mystic
        spirit was abroad, leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose to
        set her sails. Robert spoke to her incessantly; he no longer noticed
        Mariequita. The girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket. They were covered
        with Spanish moss. She beat the moss down impatiently, and muttered to
        herself sullenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go to Grande Terre to-morrow?&rdquo; said Robert in a low voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we do there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Climb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling gold
        snakes, and watch the lizards sun themselves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She gazed away toward Grande Terre and thought she would like to be alone
        there with Robert, in the sun, listening to the ocean&rsquo;s roar and watching
        the slimy lizards writhe in and out among the ruins of the old fort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the next day or the next we can sail to the Bayou Brulow,&rdquo; he went
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we do there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Anything&mdash;cast bait for fish.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ll go back to Grande Terre. Let the fish alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go wherever you like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Tonie come over and help
        me patch and trim my boat. We shall not need Beaudelet nor any one. Are
        you afraid of the pirogue?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take you some night in the pirogue when the moon shines. Maybe
        your Gulf spirit will whisper to you in which of these islands the
        treasures are hidden&mdash;direct you to the very spot, perhaps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And in a day we should be rich!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give it all to you,
        the pirate gold and every bit of treasure we could dig up. I think you
        would know how to spend it. Pirate gold isn&rsquo;t a thing to be hoarded or
        utilized. It is something to squander and throw to the four winds, for the
        fun of seeing the golden specks fly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;d share it, and scatter it together,&rdquo; he said. His face flushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        They all went together up to the quaint little Gothic church of Our Lady
        of Lourdes, gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun&rsquo;s glare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Beaudelet remained behind, tinkering at his boat, and Mariequita
        walked away with her basket of shrimps, casting a look of childish ill
        humor and reproach at Robert from the corner of her eye.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>
        XIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        A feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame Edna during the service.
        Her head began to ache, and the lights on the altar swayed before her
        eyes. Another time she might have made an effort to regain her composure;
        but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere of the church and
        reach the open air. She arose, climbing over Robert&rsquo;s feet with a muttered
        apology. Old Monsieur Farival, flurried, curious, stood up, but upon
        seeing that Robert had followed Mrs. Pontellier, he sank back into his
        seat. He whispered an anxious inquiry of the lady in black, who did not
        notice him or reply, but kept her eyes fastened upon the pages of her
        velvet prayer-book.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I felt giddy and almost overcome,&rdquo; Edna said, lifting her hands
        instinctively to her head and pushing her straw hat up from her forehead.
        &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have stayed through the service.&rdquo; They were outside in the
        shadow of the church. Robert was full of solicitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was folly to have thought of going in the first place, let alone
        staying. Come over to Madame Antoine&rsquo;s; you can rest there.&rdquo; He took her
        arm and led her away, looking anxiously and continuously down into her
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        How still it was, with only the voice of the sea whispering through the
        reeds that grew in the salt-water pools! The long line of little gray,
        weather-beaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees. It must
        always have been God&rsquo;s day on that low, drowsy island, Edna thought. They
        stopped, leaning over a jagged fence made of sea-drift, to ask for water.
        A youth, a mild-faced Acadian, was drawing water from the cistern, which
        was nothing more than a rusty buoy, with an opening on one side, sunk in
        the ground. The water which the youth handed to them in a tin pail was not
        cold to taste, but it was cool to her heated face, and it greatly revived
        and refreshed her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Antoine&rsquo;s cot was at the far end of the village. She welcomed them
        with all the native hospitality, as she would have opened her door to let
        the sunlight in. She was fat, and walked heavily and clumsily across the
        floor. She could speak no English, but when Robert made her understand
        that the lady who accompanied him was ill and desired to rest, she was all
        eagerness to make Edna feel at home and to dispose of her comfortably.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole place was immaculately clean, and the big, four-posted bed,
        snow-white, invited one to repose. It stood in a small side room which
        looked out across a narrow grass plot toward the shed, where there was a
        disabled boat lying keel upward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Antoine had not gone to mass. Her son Tonie had, but she supposed
        he would soon be back, and she invited Robert to be seated and wait for
        him. But he went and sat outside the door and smoked. Madame Antoine
        busied herself in the large front room preparing dinner. She was boiling
        mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna, left alone in the little side room, loosened her clothes, removing
        the greater part of them. She bathed her face, her neck and arms in the
        basin that stood between the windows. She took off her shoes and stockings
        and stretched herself in the very center of the high, white bed. How
        luxurious it felt to rest thus in a strange, quaint bed, with its sweet
        country odor of laurel lingering about the sheets and mattress! She
        stretched her strong limbs that ached a little. She ran her fingers
        through her loosened hair for a while. She looked at her round arms as she
        held them straight up and rubbed them one after the other, observing
        closely, as if it were something she saw for the first time, the fine,
        firm quality and texture of her flesh. She clasped her hands easily above
        her head, and it was thus she fell asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        She slept lightly at first, half awake and drowsily attentive to the
        things about her. She could hear Madame Antoine&rsquo;s heavy, scraping tread as
        she walked back and forth on the sanded floor. Some chickens were clucking
        outside the windows, scratching for bits of gravel in the grass. Later she
        half heard the voices of Robert and Tonie talking under the shed. She did
        not stir. Even her eyelids rested numb and heavily over her sleepy eyes.
        The voices went on&mdash;Tonie&rsquo;s slow, Acadian drawl, Robert&rsquo;s quick,
        soft, smooth French. She understood French imperfectly unless directly
        addressed, and the voices were only part of the other drowsy, muffled
        sounds lulling her senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Edna awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and
        soundly. The voices were hushed under the shed. Madame Antoine&rsquo;s step was
        no longer to be heard in the adjoining room. Even the chickens had gone
        elsewhere to scratch and cluck. The mosquito bar was drawn over her; the
        old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar. Edna arose
        quietly from the bed, and looking between the curtains of the window, she
        saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon was far advanced.
        Robert was out there under the shed, reclining in the shade against the
        sloping keel of the overturned boat. He was reading from a book. Tonie was
        no longer with him. She wondered what had become of the rest of the party.
        She peeped out at him two or three times as she stood washing herself in
        the little basin between the windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Antoine had laid some coarse, clean towels upon a chair, and had
        placed a box of poudre de riz within easy reach. Edna dabbed the powder
        upon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the little
        distorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin. Her eyes were
        bright and wide awake and her face glowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she had completed her toilet she walked into the adjoining room. She
        was very hungry. No one was there. But there was a cloth spread upon the
        table that stood against the wall, and a cover was laid for one, with a
        crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate. Edna bit a piece
        from the brown loaf, tearing it with her strong, white teeth. She poured
        some of the wine into the glass and drank it down. Then she went softly
        out of doors, and plucking an orange from the low-hanging bough of a tree,
        threw it at Robert, who did not know she was awake and up.
      </p>
      <p>
        An illumination broke over his whole face when he saw her and joined her
        under the orange tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How many years have I slept?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;The whole island seems
        changed. A new race of beings must have sprung up, leaving only you and me
        as past relics. How many ages ago did Madame Antoine and Tonie die? and
        when did our people from Grand Isle disappear from the earth?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He familiarly adjusted a ruffle upon her shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have slept precisely one hundred years. I was left here to guard your
        slumbers; and for one hundred years I have been out under the shed reading
        a book. The only evil I couldn&rsquo;t prevent was to keep a broiled fowl from
        drying up.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If it has turned to stone, still will I eat it,&rdquo; said Edna, moving with
        him into the house. &ldquo;But really, what has become of Monsieur Farival and
        the others?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gone hours ago. When they found that you were sleeping they thought it
        best not to awake you. Any way, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let them. What was I here
        for?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wonder if Leonce will be uneasy!&rdquo; she speculated, as she seated herself
        at table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not; he knows you are with me,&rdquo; Robert replied, as he busied
        himself among sundry pans and covered dishes which had been left standing
        on the hearth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are Madame Antoine and her son?&rdquo; asked Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gone to Vespers, and to visit some friends, I believe. I am to take you
        back in Tonie&rsquo;s boat whenever you are ready to go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle
        afresh. He served her with no mean repast, dripping the coffee anew and
        sharing it with her. Madame Antoine had cooked little else than the
        mullets, but while Edna slept Robert had foraged the island. He was
        childishly gratified to discover her appetite, and to see the relish with
        which she ate the food which he had procured for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall we go right away?&rdquo; she asked, after draining her glass and brushing
        together the crumbs of the crusty loaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sun isn&rsquo;t as low as it will be in two hours,&rdquo; he answered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sun will be gone in two hours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let it go; who cares!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They waited a good while under the orange trees, till Madame Antoine came
        back, panting, waddling, with a thousand apologies to explain her absence.
        Tonie did not dare to return. He was shy, and would not willingly face any
        woman except his mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees, while the sun
        dipped lower and lower, turning the western sky to flaming copper and
        gold. The shadows lengthened and crept out like stealthy, grotesque
        monsters across the grass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna and Robert both sat upon the ground&mdash;that is, he lay upon the
        ground beside her, occasionally picking at the hem of her muslin gown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Antoine seated her fat body, broad and squat, upon a bench beside
        the door. She had been talking all the afternoon, and had wound herself up
        to the storytelling pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what stories she told them! But twice in her life she had left the
        Cheniere Caminada, and then for the briefest span. All her years she had
        squatted and waddled there upon the island, gathering legends of the
        Baratarians and the sea. The night came on, with the moon to lighten it.
        Edna could hear the whispering voices of dead men and the click of muffled
        gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she and Robert stepped into Tonie&rsquo;s boat, with the red lateen sail,
        misty spirit forms were prowling in the shadows and among the reeds, and
        upon the water were phantom ships, speeding to cover.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <p>
        The youngest boy, Etienne, had been very naughty, Madame Ratignolle said,
        as she delivered him into the hands of his mother. He had been unwilling
        to go to bed and had made a scene; whereupon she had taken charge of him
        and pacified him as well as she could. Raoul had been in bed and asleep
        for two hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The youngster was in his long white nightgown, that kept tripping him up
        as Madame Ratignolle led him along by the hand. With the other chubby fist
        he rubbed his eyes, which were heavy with sleep and ill humor. Edna took
        him in her arms, and seating herself in the rocker, began to coddle and
        caress him, calling him all manner of tender names, soothing him to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not more than nine o&rsquo;clock. No one had yet gone to bed but the
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leonce had been very uneasy at first, Madame Ratignolle said, and had
        wanted to start at once for the Cheniere. But Monsieur Farival had assured
        him that his wife was only overcome with sleep and fatigue, that Tonie
        would bring her safely back later in the day; and he had thus been
        dissuaded from crossing the bay. He had gone over to Klein&rsquo;s, looking up
        some cotton broker whom he wished to see in regard to securities,
        exchanges, stocks, bonds, or something of the sort, Madame Ratignolle did
        not remember what. He said he would not remain away late. She herself was
        suffering from heat and oppression, she said. She carried a bottle of
        salts and a large fan. She would not consent to remain with Edna, for
        Monsieur Ratignolle was alone, and he detested above all things to be left
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Etienne had fallen asleep Edna bore him into the back room, and
        Robert went and lifted the mosquito bar that she might lay the child
        comfortably in his bed. The quadroon had vanished. When they emerged from
        the cottage Robert bade Edna good-night.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know we have been together the whole livelong day, Robert&mdash;since
        early this morning?&rdquo; she said at parting.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Goodnight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach. He did
        not join any of the others, but walked alone toward the Gulf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna stayed outside, awaiting her husband&rsquo;s return. She had no desire to
        sleep or to retire; nor did she feel like going over to sit with the
        Ratignolles, or to join Madame Lebrun and a group whose animated voices
        reached her as they sat in conversation before the house. She let her mind
        wander back over her stay at Grand Isle; and she tried to discover wherein
        this summer had been different from any and every other summer of her
        life. She could only realize that she herself&mdash;her present self&mdash;was
        in some way different from the other self. That she was seeing with
        different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions in herself
        that colored and changed her environment, she did not yet suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wondered why Robert had gone away and left her. It did not occur to
        her to think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong day.
        She was not tired, and she felt that he was not. She regretted that he had
        gone. It was so much more natural to have him stay when he was not
        absolutely required to leave her.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that Robert had
        sung as they crossed the bay. It began with &ldquo;Ah! Si tu savais,&rdquo; and every
        verse ended with &ldquo;si tu savais.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert&rsquo;s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice,
        the notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.
      </p>

    <section id="4">
      <h2>
        XV
      </h2>
      <p>
        When Edna entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her
        habit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on. Several
        persons were talking at once, and Victor&rsquo;s voice was predominating, even
        over that of his mother. Edna had returned late from her bath, had dressed
        in some haste, and her face was flushed. Her head, set off by her dainty
        white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom. She took her seat at table
        between old Monsieur Farival and Madame Ratignolle.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup, which had
        been served when she entered the room, several persons informed her
        simultaneously that Robert was going to Mexico. She laid her spoon down
        and looked about her bewildered. He had been with her, reading to her all
        the morning, and had never even mentioned such a place as Mexico. She had
        not seen him during the afternoon; she had heard some one say he was at
        the house, upstairs with his mother. This she had thought nothing of,
        though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the afternoon,
        when she went down to the beach.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked across at him, where he sat beside Madame Lebrun, who presided.
        Edna&rsquo;s face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she never thought
        of disguising. He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he
        returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy. &ldquo;When is he going?&rdquo;
        she asked of everybody in general, as if Robert were not there to answer
        for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; &ldquo;This very evening!&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you ever!&rdquo; &ldquo;What possesses him!&rdquo;
        were some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in French
        and English.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How can a person start off from Grand Isle
        to Mexico at a moment&rsquo;s notice, as if he were going over to Klein&rsquo;s or to
        the wharf or down to the beach?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said all along I was going to Mexico; I&rsquo;ve been saying so for years!&rdquo;
        cried Robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of a man
        defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Please let Robert explain why he is going, and why he is going to-night,&rdquo;
        she called out. &ldquo;Really, this table is getting to be more and more like
        Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once. Sometimes&mdash;I hope
        God will forgive me&mdash;but positively, sometimes I wish Victor would
        lose the power of speech.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish, of
        which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it might afford
        her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monsieur Farival thought that Victor should have been taken out in
        mid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. Victor thought there would be
        more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim for
        making themselves universally obnoxious. Madame Lebrun grew a trifle
        hysterical; Robert called his brother some sharp, hard names.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to explain, mother,&rdquo; he said; though he explained,
        nevertheless&mdash;looking chiefly at Edna&mdash;that he could only meet
        the gentleman whom he intended to join at Vera Cruz by taking such and
        such a steamer, which left New Orleans on such a day; that Beaudelet was
        going out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave him an
        opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But when did you make up your mind to all this?&rdquo; demanded Monsieur
        Farival.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; returned Robert, with a shade of annoyance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what time this afternoon?&rdquo; persisted the old gentleman, with nagging
        determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of
        justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, Monsieur Farival,&rdquo; Robert replied, in a
        high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded Edna of some gentleman on
        the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking
        the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak
        in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to
        no one but themselves. The lady in black had once received a pair of
        prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico, with very special
        indulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain
        whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border. Father Fochel
        of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; but he had not done so to
        her satisfaction. And she begged that Robert would interest himself, and
        discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the indulgence
        accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution in
        dealing with the Mexicans, who, she considered, were a treacherous people,
        unscrupulous and revengeful. She trusted she did them no injustice in thus
        condemning them as a race. She had known personally but one Mexican, who
        made and sold excellent tamales, and whom she would have trusted
        implicitly, so soft-spoken was he. One day he was arrested for stabbing
        his wife. She never knew whether he had been hanged or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victor had grown hilarious, and was attempting to tell an anecdote about a
        Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in Dauphine
        Street. No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival, who went into
        convulsions over the droll story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna wondered if they had all gone mad, to be talking and clamoring at
        that rate. She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or the
        Mexicans.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what time do you leave?&rdquo; she asked Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At ten,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Beaudelet wants to wait for the moon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you all ready to go?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the
        city.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna,
        having finished her black coffee, left the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        She went directly to her room. The little cottage was close and stuffy
        after leaving the outer air. But she did not mind; there appeared to be a
        hundred different things demanding her attention indoors. She began to set
        the toilet-stand to rights, grumbling at the negligence of the quadroon,
        who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed. She gathered
        together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of chairs, and put
        each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer. She changed her gown
        for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper. She rearranged her hair,
        combing and brushing it with unusual energy. Then she went in and assisted
        the quadroon in getting the boys to bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were very playful and inclined to talk&mdash;to do anything but lie
        quiet and go to sleep. Edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and told
        her she need not return. Then she sat and told the children a story.
        Instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their wakefulness. She
        left them in heated argument, speculating about the conclusion of the tale
        which their mother promised to finish the following night.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to have
        Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr. Robert
        went away. Edna returned answer that she had already undressed, that she
        did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the house later.
        She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to remove her
        peignoir. But changing her mind once more she resumed the peignoir, and
        went outside and sat down before her door. She was overheated and
        irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while. Madame Ratignolle
        came down to discover what was the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,&rdquo; replied
        Edna, &ldquo;and moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. The idea of Robert
        starting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way! As if it were
        a matter of life and death! Never saying a word about it all morning when
        he was with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Madame Ratignolle. &ldquo;I think it was showing us all&mdash;you
        especially&mdash;very little consideration. It wouldn&rsquo;t have surprised me
        in any of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics. But I must
        say I should never have expected such a thing from Robert. Are you not
        coming down? Come on, dear; it doesn&rsquo;t look friendly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Edna, a little sullenly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to the trouble of dressing
        again; I don&rsquo;t feel like it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist.
        Just look at me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; persisted Edna; &ldquo;but you go on. Madame Lebrun might be offended if
        we both stayed away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth
        rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation which
        was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you feeling well?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well enough. Are you going right away?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He lit a match and looked at his watch. &ldquo;In twenty minutes,&rdquo; he said. The
        sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while.
        He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Get a chair,&rdquo; said Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took it
        off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the
        heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take the fan,&rdquo; said Edna, offering it to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! Thank you. It does no good; you have to stop fanning some time,
        and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the ridiculous things which men always say. I have never
        known one to speak otherwise of fanning. How long will you be gone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Forever, perhaps. I don&rsquo;t know. It depends upon a good many things.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, in case it shouldn&rsquo;t be forever, how long will it be?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for. I don&rsquo;t like
        it. I don&rsquo;t understand your motive for silence and mystery, never saying a
        word to me about it this morning.&rdquo; He remained silent, not offering to
        defend himself. He only said, after a moment:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t part from me in any ill humor. I never knew you to be out of
        patience with me before.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to part in any ill humor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you
        understand? I&rsquo;ve grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all the
        time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. You don&rsquo;t even offer
        an excuse for it. Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of how
        pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So was I,&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo; He stood up suddenly
        and held out his hand. &ldquo;Good-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; good-by. You
        won&rsquo;t&mdash;I hope you won&rsquo;t completely forget me.&rdquo; She clung to his hand,
        striving to detain him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Write to me when you get there, won&rsquo;t you, Robert?&rdquo; she entreated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will, thank you. Good-by.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        How unlike Robert! The merest acquaintance would have said something more
        emphatic than &ldquo;I will, thank you; good-by,&rdquo; to such a request.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house, for
        he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out there with
        an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. They walked away in the
        darkness. She could only hear Beaudelet&rsquo;s voice; Robert had apparently not
        even spoken a word of greeting to his companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to hide,
        even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the emotion which
        was troubling&mdash;tearing&mdash;her. Her eyes were brimming with tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she
        had felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and
        later as a young woman. The recognition did not lessen the reality, the
        poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability.
        The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to
        heed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate. The
        present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing
        then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held,
        that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being
        demanded.

      </h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you miss your friend greatly?&rdquo; asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning as
        she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on her way
        to the beach. She spent much of her time in the water since she had
        acquired finally the art of swimming. As their stay at Grand Isle drew
        near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a
        diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she
        knew. When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and
        spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in
        Edna&rsquo;s mind; or, better, the feeling which constantly possessed her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert&rsquo;s going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning
        out of everything. The conditions of her life were in no way changed, but
        her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to be no
        longer worth wearing. She sought him everywhere&mdash;in others whom she
        induced to talk about him. She went up in the mornings to Madame Lebrun&rsquo;s
        room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine. She sat there and
        chatted at intervals as Robert had done. She gazed around the room at the
        pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and discovered in some
        corner an old family album, which she examined with the keenest interest,
        appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures
        and faces which she discovered between its pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in her
        lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. The eyes alone in the
        baby suggested the man. And that was he also in kilts, at the age of five,
        wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. It made Edna laugh, and
        she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers; while
        another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking thin,
        long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions. But
        there was no recent picture, none which suggested the Robert who had gone
        away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for them
        himself! He found wiser use for his money, he says,&rdquo; explained Madame
        Lebrun. She had a letter from him, written before he left New Orleans.
        Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to look for it
        either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the mantelpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
        The letter was on the bookshelf. It possessed the greatest interest and
        attraction for Edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark, the
        handwriting. She examined every detail of the outside before opening it.
        There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the city
        that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that he was
        well, and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately remembered to
        all. There was no special message to Edna except a postscript saying that
        if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish the book which he had been reading to
        her, his mother would find it in his room, among other books there on the
        table. Edna experienced a pang of jealousy because he had written to his
        mother rather than to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. Even her
        husband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert&rsquo;s departure,
        expressed regret that he had gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you get on without him, Edna?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dull without him,&rdquo; she admitted. Mr. Pontellier had seen Robert
        in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more. Where had they
        met? On Carondelet Street, in the morning. They had gone &ldquo;in&rdquo; and had a
        drink and a cigar together. What had they talked about? Chiefly about his
        prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought were promising. How did
        he look? How did he seem&mdash;grave, or gay, or how? Quite cheerful, and
        wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which Mr. Pontellier found
        altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek fortune and adventure
        in a strange, queer country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children persisted
        in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. She went down
        and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more
        attentive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making
        of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of
        him. The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way resembled
        that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever expected to
        feel. She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and
        emotions which never voiced themselves. They had never taken the form of
        struggles. They belonged to her and were her own, and she entertained the
        conviction that she had a right to them and that they concerned no one but
        herself. Edna had once told Madame Ratignolle that she would never
        sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one. Then had followed a
        rather heated argument; the two women did not appear to understand each
        other or to be talking the same language. Edna tried to appease her
        friend, to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my
        life for my children; but I wouldn&rsquo;t give myself. I can&rsquo;t make it more
        clear; it&rsquo;s only something which I am beginning to comprehend, which is
        revealing itself to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by the
        unessential,&rdquo; said Madame Ratignolle, cheerfully; &ldquo;but a woman who would
        give her life for her children could do no more than that&mdash;your Bible
        tells you so. I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t do more than that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes you could!&rdquo; laughed Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s question the morning that
        lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if
        she did not greatly miss her young friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss Robert.
        Are you going down to bathe?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I
        haven&rsquo;t been in the surf all summer,&rdquo; replied the woman, disagreeably.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should
        have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s avoidance of the water had
        furnished a theme for much pleasantry. Some among them thought it was on
        account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet, while
        others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed
        to accompany the artistic temperament. Mademoiselle offered Edna some
        chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket, by way of
        showing that she bore no ill feeling. She habitually ate chocolates for
        their sustaining quality; they contained much nutriment in small compass,
        she said. They saved her from starvation, as Madame Lebrun&rsquo;s table was
        utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame
        Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to
        pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She must feel very lonely without her son,&rdquo; said Edna, desiring to change
        the subject. &ldquo;Her favorite son, too. It must have been quite hard to let
        him go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle laughed maliciously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Her favorite son! Oh, dear! Who could have been imposing such a tale upon
        you? Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone. She has spoiled
        him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the ground he
        walks on. Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can
        earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself. Favorite
        son, indeed! I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear. I liked to see him
        and to hear him about the place the only Lebrun who is worth a pinch of
        salt. He comes to see me often in the city. I like to play to him. That
        Victor! hanging would be too good for him. It&rsquo;s a wonder Robert hasn&rsquo;t
        beaten him to death long ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought he had great patience with his brother,&rdquo; offered Edna, glad to
        be talking about Robert, no matter what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle.
        &ldquo;It was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some sort
        of claim upon. He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or walking with
        her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember
        what;&mdash;and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave him a
        thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good
        while. It&rsquo;s about time he was getting another.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was her name Mariequita?&rdquo; asked Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mariequita&mdash;yes, that was it; Mariequita. I had forgotten. Oh, she&rsquo;s
        a sly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have
        listened to her venom so long. For some reason she felt depressed, almost
        unhappy. She had not intended to go into the water; but she donned her
        bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the shade of the
        children&rsquo;s tent. The water was growing cooler as the season advanced. Edna
        plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and invigorated her.
        She remained a long time in the water, half hoping that Mademoiselle Reisz
        would not wait for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Mademoiselle waited. She was very amiable during the walk back, and
        raved much over Edna&rsquo;s appearance in her bathing suit. She talked about
        music. She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote her
        address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in
        her pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When do you leave?&rdquo; asked Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Next Monday; and you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The following week,&rdquo; answered Edna, adding, &ldquo;It has been a pleasant
        summer, hasn&rsquo;t it, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, &ldquo;rather pleasant, if it
        hadn&rsquo;t been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2>
        XVII
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New
        Orleans. It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose
        round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. The house was painted a
        dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were green. In the
        yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every
        description which flourishes in South Louisiana. Within doors the
        appointments were perfect after the conventional type. The softest carpets
        and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies hung at doors and
        windows. There were paintings, selected with judgment and discrimination,
        upon the walls. The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask which daily
        appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands were
        less generous than Mr. Pontellier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its
        various appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss. He
        greatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and derived
        genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a rare lace
        curtain&mdash;no matter what&mdash;after he had bought it and placed it
        among his household gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday afternoons&mdash;Tuesday being Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s reception day&mdash;there
        was a constant stream of callers&mdash;women who came in carriages or in
        the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance permitted. A
        light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a diminutive silver
        tray for the reception of cards, admitted them. A maid, in white fluted
        cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or chocolate, as they might
        desire. Mrs. Pontellier, attired in a handsome reception gown, remained in
        the drawing-room the entire afternoon receiving her visitors. Men
        sometimes called in the evening with their wives.
      </p>
      <p>
        This had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously followed
        since her marriage, six years before. Certain evenings during the week she
        and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o&rsquo;clock,
        and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the evening&mdash;dinner
        being served at half-past seven.
      </p>
      <p>
        He and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few
        weeks after their return from Grand Isle. They were alone together. The
        boys were being put to bed; the patter of their bare, escaping feet could
        be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon,
        lifted in mild protest and entreaty. Mrs. Pontellier did not wear her
        usual Tuesday reception gown; she was in ordinary house dress. Mr.
        Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he served
        the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tired out, Edna? Whom did you have? Many callers?&rdquo; he asked. He tasted
        his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar, mustard&mdash;everything
        within reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There were a good many,&rdquo; replied Edna, who was eating her soup with
        evident satisfaction. &ldquo;I found their cards when I got home; I was out.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation in
        his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his
        glasses. &ldquo;Why, what could have taken you out on Tuesday? What did you have
        to do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing. I simply felt like going out, and I went out.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I hope you left some suitable excuse,&rdquo; said her husband, somewhat
        appeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I left no excuse. I told Joe to say I was out, that was all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, my dear, I should think you&rsquo;d understand by this time that people
        don&rsquo;t do such things; we&rsquo;ve got to observe les convenances if we ever
        expect to get on and keep up with the procession. If you felt that you had
        to leave home this afternoon, you should have left some suitable
        explanation for your absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This soup is really impossible; it&rsquo;s strange that woman hasn&rsquo;t learned
        yet to make a decent soup. Any free-lunch stand in town serves a better
        one. Was Mrs. Belthrop here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bring the tray with the cards, Joe. I don&rsquo;t remember who was here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver
        tray, which was covered with ladies&rsquo; visiting cards. He handed it to Mrs.
        Pontellier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Give it to Mr. Pontellier,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joe offered the tray to Mr. Pontellier, and removed the soup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier scanned the names of his wife&rsquo;s callers, reading some of
        them aloud, with comments as he read.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The Misses Delasidas.&rsquo; I worked a big deal in futures for their father
        this morning; nice girls; it&rsquo;s time they were getting married. &lsquo;Mrs.
        Belthrop.&rsquo; I tell you what it is, Edna; you can&rsquo;t afford to snub Mrs.
        Belthrop. Why, Belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over. His business
        is worth a good, round sum to me. You&rsquo;d better write her a note. &lsquo;Mrs.
        James Highcamp.&rsquo; Hugh! the less you have to do with Mrs. Highcamp, the
        better. &lsquo;Madame Laforce.&rsquo; Came all the way from Carrolton, too, poor old
        soul. &lsquo;Miss Wiggs,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mrs. Eleanor Boltons.&rsquo;&rdquo; He pushed the cards aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Edna, who had been fuming. &ldquo;Why are you taking the
        thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any fuss over it. But it&rsquo;s just such seeming trifles that
        we&rsquo;ve got to take seriously; such things count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The fish was scorched. Mr. Pontellier would not touch it. Edna said she
        did not mind a little scorched taste. The roast was in some way not to his
        fancy, and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we spend money enough in this house to procure
        at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his
        self-respect.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You used to think the cook was a treasure,&rdquo; returned Edna, indifferently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps she was when she first came; but cooks are only human. They need
        looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ. Suppose I
        didn&rsquo;t look after the clerks in my office, just let them run things their
        own way; they&rsquo;d soon make a nice mess of me and my business.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose from
        table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly-seasoned
        soup.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get my dinner at the club. Good night.&rdquo; He went into the
        hall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was somewhat familiar with such scenes. They had often made her very
        unhappy. On a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of
        any desire to finish her dinner. Sometimes she had gone into the kitchen
        to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook. Once she went to her room and
        studied the cookbook during an entire evening, finally writing out a menu
        for the week, which left her harassed with a feeling that, after all, she
        had accomplished no good that was worth the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that evening Edna finished her dinner alone, with forced deliberation.
        Her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that
        lighted them. After finishing her dinner she went to her room, having
        instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim
        light which the maid had turned low. She went and stood at an open window
        and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the mystery
        and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes
        and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage. She was
        seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet, half-darkness
        which met her moods. But the voices were not soothing that came to her
        from the darkness and the sky above and the stars. They jeered and sounded
        mournful notes without promise, devoid even of hope. She turned back into
        the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without
        stopping, without resting. She carried in her hands a thin handkerchief,
        which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a ball, and flung from her. Once
        she stopped, and taking off her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet.
        When she saw it lying there, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to
        crush it. But her small boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark
        upon the little glittering circlet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it
        upon the tiles of the hearth. She wanted to destroy something. The crash
        and clatter were what she wanted to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to discover
        what was the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A vase fell upon the hearth,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;Never mind; leave it till
        morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; insisted the
        young woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon
        the carpet. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s your ring, ma&rsquo;am, under the chair.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna held out her hand, and taking the ring, slipped it upon her finger.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XVIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following morning Mr. Pontellier, upon leaving for his office, asked
        Edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new
        fixtures for the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hardly think we need new fixtures, Leonce. Don&rsquo;t let us get anything
        new; you are too extravagant. I don&rsquo;t believe you ever think of saving or
        putting by.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The way to become rich is to make money, my dear Edna, not to save it,&rdquo;
        he said. He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and
        select new fixtures. He kissed her good-by, and told her she was not
        looking well and must take care of herself. She was unusually pale and
        very quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house, and absently
        picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by. She
        inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her
        white morning gown. The boys were dragging along the banquette a small
        &ldquo;express wagon,&rdquo; which they had filled with blocks and sticks. The
        quadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a
        fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. A fruit vender was
        crying his wares in the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon her
        face. She felt no interest in anything about her. The street, the
        children, the fruit vender, the flowers growing there under her eyes, were
        all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become
        antagonistic.
      </p>
      <p>
        She went back into the house. She had thought of speaking to the cook
        concerning her blunders of the previous night; but Mr. Pontellier had
        saved her that disagreeable mission, for which she was so poorly fitted.
        Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s arguments were usually convincing with those whom he
        employed. He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna would sit down
        that evening, and possibly a few subsequent evenings, to a dinner
        deserving of the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches. She
        could see their shortcomings and defects, which were glaring in her eyes.
        She tried to work a little, but found she was not in the humor. Finally
        she gathered together a few of the sketches&mdash;those which she
        considered the least discreditable; and she carried them with her when, a
        little later, she dressed and left the house. She looked handsome and
        distinguished in her street gown. The tan of the seashore had left her
        face, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her heavy,
        yellow-brown hair. There were a few freckles on her face, and a small,
        dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple, half-hidden in her
        hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert. She was still
        under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him, realizing
        the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like an
        obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt upon
        details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way
        his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her
        thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the
        forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an
        incomprehensible longing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s. Their intimacy, begun at Grand
        Isle, had not declined, and they had seen each other with some frequency
        since their return to the city. The Ratignolles lived at no great distance
        from Edna&rsquo;s home, on the corner of a side street, where Monsieur
        Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a steady and
        prosperous trade. His father had been in the business before him, and
        Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an enviable
        reputation for integrity and clearheadedness. His family lived in
        commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side
        within the porte cochere. There was something which Edna thought very
        French, very foreign, about their whole manner of living. In the large and
        pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house, the
        Ratignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree
        musicale, sometimes diversified by card-playing. There was a friend who
        played upon the &lsquo;cello. One brought his flute and another his violin,
        while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano
        with various degrees of taste and agility. The Ratignolles&rsquo; soirees
        musicales were widely known, and it was considered a privilege to be
        invited to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had returned
        that morning from the laundry. She at once abandoned her occupation upon
        seeing Edna, who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Cite can do it as well as I; it is really her business,&rdquo; she explained
        to Edna, who apologized for interrupting her. And she summoned a young
        black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in
        checking off the list which she handed her. She told her to notice
        particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur Ratignolle&rsquo;s, which
        was missing last week, had been returned; and to be sure to set to one
        side such pieces as required mending and darning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then placing an arm around Edna&rsquo;s waist, she led her to the front of the
        house, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great
        roses that stood upon the hearth in jars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a
        neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich,
        melting curves of her white throat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,&rdquo; said Edna with a
        smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches and started
        to unfold them. &ldquo;I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I wanted to
        be doing something. What do you think of them? Do you think it worth while
        to take it up again and study some more? I might study for a while with
        Laidpore.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew that Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s opinion in such a matter would be next
        to valueless, that she herself had not alone decided, but determined; but
        she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to
        put heart into her venture.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your talent is immense, dear!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; protested Edna, well pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Immense, I tell you,&rdquo; persisted Madame Ratignolle, surveying the sketches
        one by one, at close range, then holding them at arm&rsquo;s length, narrowing
        her eyes, and dropping her head on one side. &ldquo;Surely, this Bavarian
        peasant is worthy of framing; and this basket of apples! never have I seen
        anything more lifelike. One might almost be tempted to reach out a hand
        and take one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her
        friend&rsquo;s praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth. She retained
        a few of the sketches, and gave all the rest to Madame Ratignolle, who
        appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly exhibited the
        pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a little later for
        his midday dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the earth.
        His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his goodness of
        heart, his broad charity, and common sense. He and his wife spoke English
        with an accent which was only discernible through its un-English emphasis
        and a certain carefulness and deliberation. Edna&rsquo;s husband spoke English
        with no accent whatever. The Ratignolles understood each other perfectly.
        If ever the fusion of two human beings into one has been accomplished on
        this sphere it was surely in their union.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Edna seated herself at table with them she thought, &ldquo;Better a dinner of
        herbs,&rdquo; though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner
        of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every way
        satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monsieur Ratignolle was delighted to see her, though he found her looking
        not so well as at Grand Isle, and he advised a tonic. He talked a good
        deal on various topics, a little politics, some city news and neighborhood
        gossip. He spoke with an animation and earnestness that gave an
        exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. His wife was keenly
        interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the better to
        listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them. The little
        glimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her, gave her no
        regret, no longing. It was not a condition of life which fitted her, and
        she could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui. She was moved by
        a kind of commiseration for Madame Ratignolle,&mdash;a pity for that
        colorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region
        of blind contentment, in which no moment of anguish ever visited her soul,
        in which she would never have the taste of life&rsquo;s delirium. Edna vaguely
        wondered what she meant by &ldquo;life&rsquo;s delirium.&rdquo; It had crossed her thought
        like some unsought, extraneous impression.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XIX
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to
        have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the
        tiles. She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile
        expedients. She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. She
        completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits
        of those who had called upon her. She made no ineffectual efforts to
        conduct her household en bonne menagere, going and coming as it suited her
        fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending herself to any passing
        caprice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a
        certain tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected line
        of conduct completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her absolute
        disregard for her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr. Pontellier became
        rude, Edna grew insolent. She had resolved never to take another step
        backward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household,
        and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be
        better employed contriving for the comfort of her family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel like painting,&rdquo; answered Edna. &ldquo;Perhaps I shan&rsquo;t always feel like
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then in God&rsquo;s name paint! but don&rsquo;t let the family go to the devil.
        There&rsquo;s Madame Ratignolle; because she keeps up her music, she doesn&rsquo;t let
        everything else go to chaos. And she&rsquo;s more of a musician than you are a
        painter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t a musician, and I&rsquo;m not a painter. It isn&rsquo;t on account of
        painting that I let things go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On account of what, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know. Let me alone; you bother me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It sometimes entered Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s mind to wonder if his wife were not
        growing a little unbalanced mentally. He could see plainly that she was
        not herself. That is, he could not see that she was becoming herself and
        daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment
        with which to appear before the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his office.
        Edna went up to her atelier&mdash;a bright room in the top of the house.
        She was working with great energy and interest, without accomplishing
        anything, however, which satisfied her even in the smallest degree. For a
        time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art. The boys
        posed for her. They thought it amusing at first, but the occupation soon
        lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game
        arranged especially for their entertainment. The quadroon sat for hours
        before Edna&rsquo;s palette, patient as a savage, while the house-maid took
        charge of the children, and the drawing-room went undusted. But the
        housemaid, too, served her term as model when Edna perceived that the
        young woman&rsquo;s back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that
        her hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration. While
        Edna worked she sometimes sang low the little air, &ldquo;Ah! si tu savais!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It moved her with recollections. She could hear again the ripple of the
        water, the flapping sail. She could see the glint of the moon upon the
        bay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind. A
        subtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold upon
        the brushes and making her eyes burn.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy
        to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the
        sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect
        Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar
        places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in.
        And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,&mdash;when it
        did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when
        life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms
        struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. She could not work on
        such a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood.

      <p>
        It was during such a mood that Edna hunted up Mademoiselle Reisz. She had
        not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her by their
        last interview; but she nevertheless felt a desire to see her&mdash;above
        all, to listen while she played upon the piano. Quite early in the
        afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist. Unfortunately she
        had mislaid or lost Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s card, and looking up her address
        in the city directory, she found that the woman lived on Bienville Street,
        some distance away. The directory which fell into her hands was a year or
        more old, however, and upon reaching the number indicated, Edna discovered
        that the house was occupied by a respectable family of mulattoes who had
        chambres garnies to let. They had been living there for six months, and
        knew absolutely nothing of a Mademoiselle Reisz. In fact, they knew
        nothing of any of their neighbors; their lodgers were all people of the
        highest distinction, they assured Edna. She did not linger to discuss
        class distinctions with Madame Pouponne, but hastened to a neighboring
        grocery store, feeling sure that Mademoiselle would have left her address
        with the proprietor.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew Mademoiselle Reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know her,
        he informed his questioner. In truth, he did not want to know her at all,
        or anything concerning her&mdash;the most disagreeable and unpopular woman
        who ever lived in Bienville Street. He thanked heaven she had left the
        neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know where she had
        gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna&rsquo;s desire to see Mademoiselle Reisz had increased tenfold since these
        unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. She was wondering who
        could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly occurred to
        her that Madame Lebrun would be the one most likely to do so. She knew it
        was useless to ask Madame Ratignolle, who was on the most distant terms
        with the musician, and preferred to know nothing concerning her. She had
        once been almost as emphatic in expressing herself upon the subject as the
        corner grocer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna knew that Madame Lebrun had returned to the city, for it was the
        middle of November. And she also knew where the Lebruns lived, on Chartres
        Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their home from the outside looked like a prison, with iron bars before
        the door and lower windows. The iron bars were a relic of the old regime,
        and no one had ever thought of dislodging them. At the side was a high
        fence enclosing the garden. A gate or door opening upon the street was
        locked. Edna rang the bell at this side garden gate, and stood upon the
        banquette, waiting to be admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Victor who opened the gate for her. A black woman, wiping her hands
        upon her apron, was close at his heels. Before she saw them Edna could
        hear them in altercation, the woman&mdash;plainly an anomaly&mdash;claiming
        the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to answer
        the bell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victor was surprised and delighted to see Mrs. Pontellier, and he made no
        attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight. He was a
        dark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling his
        mother, but with ten times her impetuosity. He instructed the black woman
        to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier desired to see
        her. The woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty when she had not
        been permitted to do it all, and started back to her interrupted task of
        weeding the garden. Whereupon Victor administered a rebuke in the form of
        a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity and incoherence, was all
        but incomprehensible to Edna. Whatever it was, the rebuke was convincing,
        for the woman dropped her hoe and went mumbling into the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna did not wish to enter. It was very pleasant there on the side porch,
        where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table. She seated
        herself, for she was tired from her long tramp; and she began to rock
        gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol. Victor drew up his
        chair beside her. He at once explained that the black woman&rsquo;s offensive
        conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not there to take her
        in hand. He had only come up from the island the morning before, and
        expected to return next day. He stayed all winter at the island; he lived
        there, and kept the place in order and got things ready for the summer
        visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a man needed occasional relaxation, he informed Mrs. Pontellier, and
        every now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the city. My!
        but he had had a time of it the evening before! He wouldn&rsquo;t want his
        mother to know, and he began to talk in a whisper. He was scintillant with
        recollections. Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t think of telling Mrs. Pontellier all
        about it, she being a woman and not comprehending such things. But it all
        began with a girl peeping and smiling at him through the shutters as he
        passed by. Oh! but she was a beauty! Certainly he smiled back, and went up
        and talked to her. Mrs. Pontellier did not know him if she supposed he was
        one to let an opportunity like that escape him. Despite herself, the
        youngster amused her. She must have betrayed in her look some degree of
        interest or entertainment. The boy grew more daring, and Mrs. Pontellier
        might have found herself, in a little while, listening to a highly colored
        story but for the timely appearance of Madame Lebrun.
      </p>
      <p>
        That lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the summer.
        Her eyes beamed an effusive welcome. Would not Mrs. Pontellier go inside?
        Would she partake of some refreshment? Why had she not been there before?
        How was that dear Mr. Pontellier and how were those sweet children? Had
        Mrs. Pontellier ever known such a warm November?
      </p>
      <p>
        Victor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother&rsquo;s chair,
        where he commanded a view of Edna&rsquo;s face. He had taken her parasol from
        her hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and twirled it above
        him as he lay on his back. When Madame Lebrun complained that it was so
        dull coming back to the city; that she saw so few people now; that even
        Victor, when he came up from the island for a day or two, had so much to
        occupy him and engage his time; then it was that the youth went into
        contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at Edna. She somehow
        felt like a confederate in crime, and tried to look severe and
        disapproving.
      </p>
      <p>
        There had been but two letters from Robert, with little in them, they told
        her. Victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for the
        letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them. He
        remembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when
        put to the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        One letter was written from Vera Cruz and the other from the City of
        Mexico. He had met Montel, who was doing everything toward his
        advancement. So far, the financial situation was no improvement over the
        one he had left in New Orleans, but of course the prospects were vastly
        better. He wrote of the City of Mexico, the buildings, the people and
        their habits, the conditions of life which he found there. He sent his
        love to the family. He inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she would
        affectionately remember him to all his friends. That was about the
        substance of the two letters. Edna felt that if there had been a message
        for her, she would have received it. The despondent frame of mind in which
        she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered that she
        wished to find Mademoiselle Reisz.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Lebrun knew where Mademoiselle Reisz lived. She gave Edna the
        address, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the
        remainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to Mademoiselle Reisz some
        other day. The afternoon was already well advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held
        it over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her to bear
        in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential.
        She laughed and bantered him a little, remembering too late that she
        should have been dignified and reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How handsome Mrs. Pontellier looked!&rdquo; said Madame Lebrun to her son.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ravishing!&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;The city atmosphere has improved her. Some way
        she doesn&rsquo;t seem like the same woman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXI
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose
        apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars,
        peddlars and callers. There were plenty of windows in her little front
        room. They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always
        open it did not make so much difference. They often admitted into the room
        a good deal of smoke and soot; but at the same time all the light and air
        that there was came through them. From her windows could be seen the
        crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the
        Mississippi steamers. A magnificent piano crowded the apartment. In the
        next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline
        stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the
        neighboring restaurant. It was there also that she ate, keeping her
        belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred years
        of use.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s front room door and entered, she
        discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in mending or
        patching an old prunella gaiter. The little musician laughed all over when
        she saw Edna. Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the
        muscles of the body. She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the
        afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch
        of violets on the side of her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So you remembered me at last,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle. &ldquo;I had said to myself,
        &lsquo;Ah, bah! she will never come.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you want me to come?&rdquo; asked Edna with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had not thought much about it,&rdquo; answered Mademoiselle. The two had
        seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall. &ldquo;I
        am glad, however, that you came. I have the water boiling back there, and
        was just about to make some coffee. You will drink a cup with me. And how
        is la belle dame? Always handsome! always healthy! always contented!&rdquo; She
        took Edna&rsquo;s hand between her strong wiry fingers, holding it loosely
        without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and
        palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;I sometimes thought: &lsquo;She will never come. She
        promised as those women in society always do, without meaning it. She will
        not come.&rsquo; For I really don&rsquo;t believe you like me, Mrs. Pontellier.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I like you or not,&rdquo; replied Edna, gazing down at the
        little woman with a quizzical look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The candor of Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle
        Reisz. She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the
        region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup
        of coffee. The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very
        acceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun&rsquo;s and
        was now beginning to feel hungry. Mademoiselle set the tray which she
        brought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once again
        on the lumpy sofa.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have had a letter from your friend,&rdquo; she remarked, as she poured a
        little cream into Edna&rsquo;s cup and handed it to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, your friend Robert. He wrote to me from the City of Mexico.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wrote to YOU?&rdquo; repeated Edna in amazement, stirring her coffee absently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, to me. Why not? Don&rsquo;t stir all the warmth out of your coffee; drink
        it. Though the letter might as well have been sent to you; it was nothing
        but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; requested the young woman, entreatingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to
        whom it is written.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was written about you, not to you. &lsquo;Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier? How
        is she looking?&rsquo; he asks. &lsquo;As Mrs. Pontellier says,&rsquo; or &lsquo;as Mrs.
        Pontellier once said.&rsquo; &lsquo;If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you, play for
        her that Impromptu of Chopin&rsquo;s, my favorite. I heard it here a day or two
        ago, but not as you play it. I should like to know how it affects her,&rsquo; 
        and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each other&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me see the letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you answered it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me see the letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, and again, no.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then play the Impromptu for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is growing late; what time do you have to be home?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Time doesn&rsquo;t concern me. Your question seems a little rude. Play the
        Impromptu.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you have told me nothing of yourself. What are you doing?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Painting!&rdquo; laughed Edna. &ldquo;I am becoming an artist. Think of it!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! an artist! You have pretensions, Madame.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why pretensions? Do you think I could not become an artist?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know you well enough to say. I do not know your talent or your
        temperament. To be an artist includes much; one must possess many gifts&mdash;absolute
        gifts&mdash;which have not been acquired by one&rsquo;s own effort. And,
        moreover, to succeed, the artist must possess the courageous soul.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean by the courageous soul?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Courageous, ma foi! The brave soul. The soul that dares and defies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Show me the letter and play for me the Impromptu. You see that I have
        persistence. Does that quality count for anything in art?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated,&rdquo; replied
        Mademoiselle, with her wriggling laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon
        which Edna had just placed her coffee cup. Mademoiselle opened the drawer
        and drew forth the letter, the topmost one. She placed it in Edna&rsquo;s hands,
        and without further comment arose and went to the piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle played a soft interlude. It was an improvisation. She sat low
        at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful
        curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and
        imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of
        the Chopin Impromptu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended. She sat in the sofa
        corner reading Robert&rsquo;s letter by the fading light. Mademoiselle had
        glided from the Chopin into the quivering love notes of Isolde&rsquo;s song, and
        back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shadows deepened in the little room. The music grew strange and
        fantastic&mdash;turbulent, insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty.
        The shadows grew deeper. The music filled the room. It floated out upon
        the night, over the housetops, the crescent of the river, losing itself in
        the silence of the upper air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when
        strange, new voices awoke in her. She arose in some agitation to take her
        departure. &ldquo;May I come again, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; she asked at the threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come whenever you feel like it. Be careful; the stairs and landings are
        dark; don&rsquo;t stumble.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle. Robert&rsquo;s letter was on the floor.
        She stooped and picked it up. It was crumpled and damp with tears.
        Mademoiselle smoothed the letter out, restored it to the envelope, and
        replaced it in the table drawer.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXII
      </h2>
      <p>
        One morning on his way into town Mr. Pontellier stopped at the house of
        his old friend and family physician, Doctor Mandelet. The Doctor was a
        semi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels. He
        bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill&mdash;leaving the active
        practice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries&mdash;and
        was much sought for in matters of consultation. A few families, united to
        him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the
        services of a physician. The Pontelliers were among these.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier found the Doctor reading at the open window of his study.
        His house stood rather far back from the street, in the center of a
        delightful garden, so that it was quiet and peaceful at the old
        gentleman&rsquo;s study window. He was a great reader. He stared up
        disapprovingly over his eye-glasses as Mr. Pontellier entered, wondering
        who had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Pontellier! Not sick, I hope. Come and have a seat. What news do you
        bring this morning?&rdquo; He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray hair,
        and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but
        none of their penetration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m never sick, Doctor. You know that I come of tough fiber&mdash;of
        that old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away. I
        came to consult&mdash;no, not precisely to consult&mdash;to talk to you
        about Edna. I don&rsquo;t know what ails her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame Pontellier not well,&rdquo; marveled the Doctor. &ldquo;Why, I saw her&mdash;I
        think it was a week ago&mdash;walking along Canal Street, the picture of
        health, it seemed to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes; she seems quite well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pontellier, leaning forward and
        whirling his stick between his two hands; &ldquo;but she doesn&rsquo;t act well. She&rsquo;s
        odd, she&rsquo;s not like herself. I can&rsquo;t make her out, and I thought perhaps
        you&rsquo;d help me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How does she act?&rdquo; inquired the Doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t easy to explain,&rdquo; said Mr. Pontellier, throwing himself
        back in his chair. &ldquo;She lets the housekeeping go to the dickens.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well; women are not all alike, my dear Pontellier. We&rsquo;ve got to
        consider&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know that; I told you I couldn&rsquo;t explain. Her whole attitude&mdash;toward
        me and everybody and everything&mdash;has changed. You know I have a quick
        temper, but I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel or be rude to a woman, especially my
        wife; yet I&rsquo;m driven to it, and feel like ten thousand devils after I&rsquo;ve
        made a fool of myself. She&rsquo;s making it devilishly uncomfortable for me,&rdquo;
        he went on nervously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got some sort of notion in her head
        concerning the eternal rights of women; and&mdash;you understand&mdash;we
        meet in the morning at the breakfast table.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows, protruded his thick nether
        lip, and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What have you been doing to her, Pontellier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doing! Parbleu!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has she,&rdquo; asked the Doctor, with a smile, &ldquo;has she been associating of
        late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women&mdash;super-spiritual
        superior beings? My wife has been telling me about them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Pontellier, &ldquo;she hasn&rsquo;t been
        associating with any one. She has abandoned her Tuesdays at home, has
        thrown over all her acquaintances, and goes tramping about by herself,
        moping in the street-cars, getting in after dark. I tell you she&rsquo;s
        peculiar. I don&rsquo;t like it; I feel a little worried over it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a new aspect for the Doctor. &ldquo;Nothing hereditary?&rdquo; he asked,
        seriously. &ldquo;Nothing peculiar about her family antecedents, is there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed! She comes of sound old Presbyterian Kentucky stock. The
        old gentleman, her father, I have heard, used to atone for his weekday
        sins with his Sunday devotions. I know for a fact, that his race horses
        literally ran away with the prettiest bit of Kentucky farming land I ever
        laid eyes upon. Margaret&mdash;you know Margaret&mdash;she has all the
        Presbyterianism undiluted. And the youngest is something of a vixen. By
        the way, she gets married in a couple of weeks from now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send your wife up to the wedding,&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor, foreseeing a
        happy solution. &ldquo;Let her stay among her own people for a while; it will do
        her good.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want her to do. She won&rsquo;t go to the marriage. She says a
        wedding is one of the most lamentable spectacles on earth. Nice thing for
        a woman to say to her husband!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pontellier, fuming anew at
        the recollection.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pontellier,&rdquo; said the Doctor, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;let your wife
        alone for a while. Don&rsquo;t bother her, and don&rsquo;t let her bother you. Woman,
        my dear friend, is a very peculiar and delicate organism&mdash;a sensitive
        and highly organized woman, such as I know Mrs. Pontellier to be, is
        especially peculiar. It would require an inspired psychologist to deal
        successfully with them. And when ordinary fellows like you and me attempt
        to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling. Most women are
        moody and whimsical. This is some passing whim of your wife, due to some
        cause or causes which you and I needn&rsquo;t try to fathom. But it will pass
        happily over, especially if you let her alone. Send her around to see me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I couldn&rsquo;t do that; there&rsquo;d be no reason for it,&rdquo; objected Mr.
        Pontellier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go around and see her,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop in to
        dinner some evening en bon ami.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do! by all means,&rdquo; urged Mr. Pontellier. &ldquo;What evening will you come? Say
        Thursday. Will you come Thursday?&rdquo; he asked, rising to take his leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well; Thursday. My wife may possibly have some engagement for me
        Thursday. In case she has, I shall let you know. Otherwise, you may expect
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier turned before leaving to say:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going to New York on business very soon. I have a big scheme on
        hand, and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle the
        ribbons. We&rsquo;ll let you in on the inside if you say so, Doctor,&rdquo; he
        laughed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I thank you, my dear sir,&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;I leave such
        ventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your blood.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What I wanted to say,&rdquo; continued Mr. Pontellier, with his hand on the
        knob; &ldquo;I may have to be absent a good while. Would you advise me to take
        Edna along?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means, if she wishes to go. If not, leave her here. Don&rsquo;t
        contradict her. The mood will pass, I assure you. It may take a month,
        two, three months&mdash;possibly longer, but it will pass; have patience.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, good-by, a jeudi,&rdquo; said Mr. Pontellier, as he let himself out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask, &ldquo;Is
        there any man in the case?&rdquo; but he knew his Creole too well to make such a
        blunder as that.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did not resume his book immediately, but sat for a while meditatively
        looking out into the garden.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna&rsquo;s father was in the city, and had been with them several days. She
        was not very warmly or deeply attached to him, but they had certain tastes
        in common, and when together they were companionable. His coming was in
        the nature of a welcome disturbance; it seemed to furnish a new direction
        for her emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter, Janet, and an
        outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her
        marriage. Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift, as every one
        immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such
        matters. And his suggestions on the question of dress&mdash;which too
        often assumes the nature of a problem&mdash;were of inestimable value to
        his father-in-law. But for the past few days the old gentleman had been
        upon Edna&rsquo;s hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a
        new set of sensations. He had been a colonel in the Confederate army, and
        still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always
        accompanied it. His hair and mustache were white and silky, emphasizing
        the rugged bronze of his face. He was tall and thin, and wore his coats
        padded, which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders and
        chest. Edna and her father looked very distinguished together, and excited
        a good deal of notice during their perambulations. Upon his arrival she
        began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch of him. He
        took the whole matter very seriously. If her talent had been ten-fold
        greater than it was, it would not have surprised him, convinced as he was
        that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful
        capability, which only depended upon their own efforts to be directed
        toward successful achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching, as he had faced the
        cannon&rsquo;s mouth in days gone by. He resented the intrusion of the children,
        who gaped with wondering eyes at him, sitting so stiff up there in their
        mother&rsquo;s bright atelier. When they drew near he motioned them away with an
        expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the fixed lines of his
        countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna, anxious to entertain him, invited Mademoiselle Reisz to meet him,
        having promised him a treat in her piano playing; but Mademoiselle
        declined the invitation. So together they attended a soiree musicale at
        the Ratignolles&rsquo;. Monsieur and Madame Ratignolle made much of the Colonel,
        installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at once to dine with
        them the following Sunday, or any day which he might select. Madame
        coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive manner, with eyes,
        gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the Colonel&rsquo;s old head felt
        thirty years younger on his padded shoulders. Edna marveled, not
        comprehending. She herself was almost devoid of coquetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale; but
        she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract their
        notice&mdash;to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward
        them. Their personality attracted her in an agreeable way. Her fancy
        selected them, and she was glad when a lull in the music gave them an
        opportunity to meet her and talk with her. Often on the street the glance
        of strange eyes had lingered in her memory, and sometimes had disturbed
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier did not attend these soirees musicales. He considered them
        bourgeois, and found more diversion at the club. To Madame Ratignolle he
        said the music dispensed at her soirees was too &ldquo;heavy,&rdquo; too far beyond
        his untrained comprehension. His excuse flattered her. But she disapproved
        of Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s club, and she was frank enough to tell Edna so.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity Mr. Pontellier doesn&rsquo;t stay home more in the evenings. I
        think you would be more&mdash;well, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying it&mdash;more
        united, if he did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! dear no!&rdquo; said Edna, with a blank look in her eyes. &ldquo;What should I do
        if he stayed home? We wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to say to each other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She had not much of anything to say to her father, for that matter; but he
        did not antagonize her. She discovered that he interested her, though she
        realized that he might not interest her long; and for the first time in
        her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him. He kept
        her busy serving him and ministering to his wants. It amused her to do so.
        She would not permit a servant or one of the children to do anything for
        him which she might do herself. Her husband noticed, and thought it was
        the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had never suspected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colonel drank numerous &ldquo;toddies&rdquo; during the course of the day, which
        left him, however, imperturbed. He was an expert at concocting strong
        drinks. He had even invented some, to which he had given fantastic names,
        and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it devolved
        upon Edna to procure for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Doctor Mandelet dined with the Pontelliers on Thursday he could
        discern in Mrs. Pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her
        husband had reported to him. She was excited and in a manner radiant. She
        and her father had been to the race course, and their thoughts when they
        seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of the
        afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. The Doctor had not kept
        pace with turf affairs. He had certain recollections of racing in what he
        called &ldquo;the good old times&rdquo; when the Lecompte stables flourished, and he
        drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not be left out and seem
        wholly devoid of the modern spirit. But he failed to impose upon the
        Colonel, and was even far from impressing him with this trumped-up
        knowledge of bygone days. Edna had staked her father on his last venture,
        with the most gratifying results to both of them. Besides, they had met
        some very charming people, according to the Colonel&rsquo;s impressions. Mrs.
        Mortimer Merriman and Mrs. James Highcamp, who were there with Alcee
        Arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the hours in a fashion that
        warmed him to think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and
        was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially when he
        considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in Kentucky. He endeavored, in
        a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and only succeeded in
        arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law. A pretty dispute
        followed, in which Edna warmly espoused her father&rsquo;s cause and the Doctor
        remained neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        He observed his hostess attentively from under his shaggy brows, and noted
        a subtle change which had transformed her from the listless woman he had
        known into a being who, for the moment, seemed palpitant with the forces
        of life. Her speech was warm and energetic. There was no repression in her
        glance or gesture. She reminded him of some beautiful, sleek animal waking
        up in the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dinner was excellent. The claret was warm and the champagne was cold,
        and under their beneficent influence the threatened unpleasantness melted
        and vanished with the fumes of the wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent. He told some amusing
        plantation experiences, recollections of old Iberville and his youth, when
        he hunted &lsquo;possum in company with some friendly darky; thrashed the pecan
        trees, shot the grosbec, and roamed the woods and fields in mischievous
        idleness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colonel, with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things,
        related a somber episode of those dark and bitter days, in which he had
        acted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure. Nor was the
        Doctor happier in his selection, when he told the old, ever new and
        curious story of the waning of a woman&rsquo;s love, seeking strange, new
        channels, only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce
        unrest. It was one of the many little human documents which had been
        unfolded to him during his long career as a physician. The story did not
        seem especially to impress Edna. She had one of her own to tell, of a
        woman who paddled away with her lover one night in a pirogue and never
        came back. They were lost amid the Baratarian Islands, and no one ever
        heard of them or found trace of them from that day to this. It was a pure
        invention. She said that Madame Antoine had related it to her. That, also,
        was an invention. Perhaps it was a dream she had had. But every glowing
        word seemed real to those who listened. They could feel the hot breath of
        the Southern night; they could hear the long sweep of the pirogue through
        the glistening moonlit water, the beating of birds&rsquo; wings, rising startled
        from among the reeds in the salt-water pools; they could see the faces of
        the lovers, pale, close together, rapt in oblivious forgetfulness,
        drifting into the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The champagne was cold, and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks with
        Edna&rsquo;s memory that night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside, away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight, the night
        was chill and murky. The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak across his
        breast as he strode home through the darkness. He knew his
        fellow-creatures better than most men; knew that inner life which so
        seldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. He was sorry he had accepted
        Pontellier&rsquo;s invitation. He was growing old, and beginning to need rest
        and an imperturbed spirit. He did not want the secrets of other lives
        thrust upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t Arobin,&rdquo; he muttered to himself as he walked. &ldquo;I hope to
        heaven it isn&rsquo;t Alcee Arobin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXIV
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the
        subject of her refusal to attend her sister&rsquo;s wedding. Mr. Pontellier
        declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his authority.
        He was following Doctor Mandelet&rsquo;s advice, and letting her do as she
        liked. The Colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of filial kindness
        and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly consideration. His
        arguments were labored and unconvincing. He doubted if Janet would accept
        any excuse&mdash;forgetting that Edna had offered none. He doubted if
        Janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure Margaret would not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself off
        with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded shoulders,
        his Bible reading, his &ldquo;toddies&rdquo; and ponderous oaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Pontellier followed him closely. He meant to stop at the wedding on
        his way to New York and endeavor by every means which money and love could
        devise to atone somewhat for Edna&rsquo;s incomprehensible action.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are too lenient, too lenient by far, Leonce,&rdquo; asserted the Colonel.
        &ldquo;Authority, coercion are what is needed. Put your foot down good and hard;
        the only way to manage a wife. Take my word for it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into her
        grave. Mr. Pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought it
        needless to mention at that late day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband&rsquo;s leaving home as she
        had been over the departure of her father. As the day approached when he
        was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting and
        affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated
        expressions of an ardent attachment. She was solicitous about his health
        and his welfare. She bustled around, looking after his clothing, thinking
        about heavy underwear, quite as Madame Ratignolle would have done under
        similar circumstances. She cried when he went away, calling him her dear,
        good friend, and she was quite certain she would grow lonely before very
        long and go to join him in New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after all, a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found
        herself alone. Even the children were gone. Old Madame Pontellier had come
        herself and carried them off to Iberville with their quadroon. The old
        madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be neglected
        during Leonce&rsquo;s absence; she hardly ventured to think so. She was hungry
        for them&mdash;even a little fierce in her attachment. She did not want
        them to be wholly &ldquo;children of the pavement,&rdquo; she always said when begging
        to have them for a space. She wished them to know the country, with its
        streams, its fields, its woods, its freedom, so delicious to the young.
        She wished them to taste something of the life their father had lived and
        known and loved when he, too, was a little child.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Edna was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of relief. A
        feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her. She walked
        all through the house, from one room to another, as if inspecting it for
        the first time. She tried the various chairs and lounges, as if she had
        never sat and reclined upon them before. And she perambulated around the
        outside of the house, investigating, looking to see if windows and
        shutters were secure and in order. The flowers were like new
        acquaintances; she approached them in a familiar spirit, and made herself
        at home among them. The garden walks were damp, and Edna called to the
        maid to bring out her rubber sandals. And there she stayed, and stooped,
        digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves. The
        children&rsquo;s little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way. She
        scolded him, laughed at him, played with him. The garden smelled so good
        and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight. Edna plucked all the
        bright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she and
        the little dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had
        never before perceived. She went in to give directions to the cook, to say
        that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they would
        require only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and groceries.
        She told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied during Mr.
        Pontellier&rsquo;s absence, and she begged her to take all thought and
        responsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night Edna dined alone. The candelabra, with a few candles in the
        center of the table, gave all the light she needed. Outside the circle of
        light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and shadowy.
        The cook, placed upon her mettle, served a delicious repast&mdash;a
        luscious tenderloin broiled a point. The wine tasted good; the marron
        glace seemed to be just what she wanted. It was so pleasant, too, to dine
        in a comfortable peignoir.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought a little sentimentally about Leonce and the children, and
        wondered what they were doing. As she gave a dainty scrap or two to the
        doggie, she talked intimately to him about Etienne and Raoul. He was
        beside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable
        advances, and showed his appreciation by his little quick, snappy barks
        and a lively agitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Edna sat in the library after dinner and read Emerson until she grew
        sleepy. She realized that she had neglected her reading, and determined to
        start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that her time was
        completely her own to do with as she liked.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a refreshing bath, Edna went to bed. And as she snuggled comfortably
        beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her, such as she had
        not known before.
      </p>

    <section id="6">
      <h2>
        XXV
      </h2>
      <p>
        When the weather was dark and cloudy Edna could not work. She needed the
        sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. She had reached a
        stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way, working, when in
        the humor, with sureness and ease. And being devoid of ambition, and
        striving not toward accomplishment, she drew satisfaction from the work in
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        On rainy or melancholy days Edna went out and sought the society of the
        friends she had made at Grand Isle. Or else she stayed indoors and nursed
        a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own comfort and
        peace of mind. It was not despair; but it seemed to her as if life were
        passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled. Yet there were
        other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by fresh promises
        which her youth held out to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She went again to the races, and again. Alcee Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp
        called for her one bright afternoon in Arobin&rsquo;s drag. Mrs. Highcamp was a
        worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the
        forties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. She had a
        daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of young
        men of fashion. Alcee Arobin was one of them. He was a familiar figure at
        the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. There was a perpetual
        smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to awaken a corresponding
        cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened to his
        good-humored voice. His manner was quiet, and at times a little insolent.
        He possessed a good figure, a pleasing face, not overburdened with depth
        of thought or feeling; and his dress was that of the conventional man of
        fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        He admired Edna extravagantly, after meeting her at the races with her
        father. He had met her before on other occasions, but she had seemed to
        him unapproachable until that day. It was at his instigation that Mrs.
        Highcamp called to ask her to go with them to the Jockey Club to witness
        the turf event of the season.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as
        well as Edna, but there was certainly none who knew it better. She sat
        between her two companions as one having authority to speak. She laughed
        at Arobin&rsquo;s pretensions, and deplored Mrs. Highcamp&rsquo;s ignorance. The race
        horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood. The atmosphere
        of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her
        memory and lingered in her nostrils. She did not perceive that she was
        talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in review before
        them. She played for very high stakes, and fortune favored her. The fever
        of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes, and it got into her blood and
        into her brain like an intoxicant. People turned their heads to look at
        her, and more than one lent an attentive ear to her utterances, hoping
        thereby to secure the elusive but ever-desired &ldquo;tip.&rdquo; Arobin caught the
        contagion of excitement which drew him to Edna like a magnet. Mrs.
        Highcamp remained, as usual, unmoved, with her indifferent stare and
        uplifted eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna stayed and dined with Mrs. Highcamp upon being urged to do so. Arobin
        also remained and sent away his drag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dinner was quiet and uninteresting, save for the cheerful efforts of
        Arobin to enliven things. Mrs. Highcamp deplored the absence of her
        daughter from the races, and tried to convey to her what she had missed by
        going to the &ldquo;Dante reading&rdquo; instead of joining them. The girl held a
        geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing, but looked knowing and
        noncommittal. Mr. Highcamp was a plain, bald-headed man, who only talked
        under compulsion. He was unresponsive. Mrs. Highcamp was full of delicate
        courtesy and consideration toward her husband. She addressed most of her
        conversation to him at table. They sat in the library after dinner and
        read the evening papers together under the droplight; while the younger
        people went into the drawing-room near by and talked. Miss Highcamp played
        some selections from Grieg upon the piano. She seemed to have apprehended
        all of the composer&rsquo;s coldness and none of his poetry. While Edna listened
        she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came for her to go home, Mr. Highcamp grunted a lame offer
        to escort her, looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern.
        It was Arobin who took her home. The car ride was long, and it was late
        when they reached Esplanade Street. Arobin asked permission to enter for a
        second to light his cigarette&mdash;his match safe was empty. He filled
        his match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after
        she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was neither tired nor sleepy. She was hungry again, for the Highcamp
        dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She rummaged in
        the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers. She
        opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox. Edna felt extremely
        restless and excited. She vacantly hummed a fantastic tune as she poked at
        the wood embers on the hearth and munched a cracker.
      </p>
      <p>
        She wanted something to happen&mdash;something, anything; she did not know
        what. She regretted that she had not made Arobin stay a half hour to talk
        over the horses with her. She counted the money she had won. But there was
        nothing else to do, so she went to bed, and tossed there for hours in a
        sort of monotonous agitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to write
        her regular letter to her husband; and she decided to do so next day and
        tell him about her afternoon at the Jockey Club. She lay wide awake
        composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote next
        day. When the maid awoke her in the morning Edna was dreaming of Mr.
        Highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on Canal
        Street, while his wife was saying to Alcee Arobin, as they boarded an
        Esplanade Street car:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity that so much talent has been neglected! but I must go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        When, a few days later, Alcee Arobin again called for Edna in his drag,
        Mrs. Highcamp was not with him. He said they would pick her up. But as
        that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up, she
        was not at home. The daughter was just leaving the house to attend the
        meeting of a branch Folk Lore Society, and regretted that she could not
        accompany them. Arobin appeared nonplused, and asked Edna if there were
        any one else she cared to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        She did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the fashionable
        acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself. She thought of Madame
        Ratignolle, but knew that her fair friend did not leave the house, except
        to take a languid walk around the block with her husband after nightfall.
        Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed at such a request from Edna. Madame
        Lebrun might have enjoyed the outing, but for some reason Edna did not
        want her. So they went alone, she and Arobin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The afternoon was intensely interesting to her. The excitement came back
        upon her like a remittent fever. Her talk grew familiar and confidential.
        It was no labor to become intimate with Arobin. His manner invited easy
        confidence. The preliminary stage of becoming acquainted was one which he
        always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging woman was
        concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stayed and dined with Edna. He stayed and sat beside the wood fire.
        They laughed and talked; and before it was time to go he was telling her
        how different life might have been if he had known her years before. With
        ingenuous frankness he spoke of what a wicked, ill-disciplined boy he had
        been, and impulsively drew up his cuff to exhibit upon his wrist the scar
        from a saber cut which he had received in a duel outside of Paris when he
        was nineteen. She touched his hand as she scanned the red cicatrice on the
        inside of his white wrist. A quick impulse that was somewhat spasmodic
        impelled her fingers to close in a sort of clutch upon his hand. He felt
        the pressure of her pointed nails in the flesh of his palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        She arose hastily and walked toward the mantel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sight of a wound or scar always agitates and sickens me,&rdquo; she said.
        &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have looked at it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he entreated, following her; &ldquo;it never occurred to me
        that it might be repulsive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He stood close to her, and the effrontery in his eyes repelled the old,
        vanishing self in her, yet drew all her awakening sensuousness. He saw
        enough in her face to impel him to take her hand and hold it while he said
        his lingering good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you go to the races again?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of the races. I don&rsquo;t want to lose all
        the money I&rsquo;ve won, and I&rsquo;ve got to work when the weather is bright,
        instead of&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; work; to be sure. You promised to show me your work. What morning
        may I come up to your atelier? To-morrow?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Day after?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t refuse me! I know something of such things. I might help
        you with a stray suggestion or two.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No. Good night. Why don&rsquo;t you go after you have said good night? I don&rsquo;t
        like you,&rdquo; she went on in a high, excited pitch, attempting to draw away
        her hand. She felt that her words lacked dignity and sincerity, and she
        knew that he felt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like me. I&rsquo;m sorry I offended you. How have I
        offended you? What have I done? Can&rsquo;t you forgive me?&rdquo; And he bent and
        pressed his lips upon her hand as if he wished never more to withdraw
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mr. Arobin,&rdquo; she complained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly upset by the excitement of the
        afternoon; I&rsquo;m not myself. My manner must have misled you in some way. I
        wish you to go, please.&rdquo; She spoke in a monotonous, dull tone. He took his
        hat from the table, and stood with eyes turned from her, looking into the
        dying fire. For a moment or two he kept an impressive silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your manner has not misled me, Mrs. Pontellier,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;My own
        emotions have done that. I couldn&rsquo;t help it. When I&rsquo;m near you, how could
        I help it? Don&rsquo;t think anything of it, don&rsquo;t bother, please. You see, I go
        when you command me. If you wish me to stay away, I shall do so. If you
        let me come back, I&mdash;oh! you will let me come back?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He cast one appealing glance at her, to which she made no response. Alcee
        Arobin&rsquo;s manner was so genuine that it often deceived even himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna did not care or think whether it were genuine or not. When she was
        alone she looked mechanically at the back of her hand which he had kissed
        so warmly. Then she leaned her head down on the mantelpiece. She felt
        somewhat like a woman who in a moment of passion is betrayed into an act
        of infidelity, and realizes the significance of the act without being
        wholly awakened from its glamour. The thought was passing vaguely through
        her mind, &ldquo;What would he think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She did not mean her husband; she was thinking of Robert Lebrun. Her
        husband seemed to her now like a person whom she had married without love
        as an excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        She lit a candle and went up to her room. Alcee Arobin was absolutely
        nothing to her. Yet his presence, his manners, the warmth of his glances,
        and above all the touch of his lips upon her hand had acted like a
        narcotic upon her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She slept a languorous sleep, interwoven with vanishing dreams.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXVI
      </h2>
      <p>
        Alcee Arobin wrote Edna an elaborate note of apology, palpitant with
        sincerity. It embarrassed her; for in a cooler, quieter moment it appeared
        to her, absurd that she should have taken his action so seriously, so
        dramatically. She felt sure that the significance of the whole occurrence
        had lain in her own self-consciousness. If she ignored his note it would
        give undue importance to a trivial affair. If she replied to it in a
        serious spirit it would still leave in his mind the impression that she
        had in a susceptible moment yielded to his influence. After all, it was no
        great matter to have one&rsquo;s hand kissed. She was provoked at his having
        written the apology. She answered in as light and bantering a spirit as
        she fancied it deserved, and said she would be glad to have him look in
        upon her at work whenever he felt the inclination and his business gave
        him the opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        He responded at once by presenting himself at her home with all his
        disarming naivete. And then there was scarcely a day which followed that
        she did not see him or was not reminded of him. He was prolific in
        pretexts. His attitude became one of good-humored subservience and tacit
        adoration. He was ready at all times to submit to her moods, which were as
        often kind as they were cold. She grew accustomed to him. They became
        intimate and friendly by imperceptible degrees, and then by leaps. He
        sometimes talked in a way that astonished her at first and brought the
        crimson into her face; in a way that pleased her at last, appealing to the
        animalism that stirred impatiently within her.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was nothing which so quieted the turmoil of Edna&rsquo;s senses as a visit
        to Mademoiselle Reisz. It was then, in the presence of that personality
        which was offensive to her, that the woman, by her divine art, seemed to
        reach Edna&rsquo;s spirit and set it free.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was misty, with heavy, lowering atmosphere, one afternoon, when Edna
        climbed the stairs to the pianist&rsquo;s apartments under the roof. Her clothes
        were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as she entered
        the room. Mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a little
        and warmed the room indifferently. She was endeavoring to heat a pot of
        chocolate on the stove. The room looked cheerless and dingy to Edna as she
        entered. A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust, scowled at her
        from the mantelpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! here comes the sunlight!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle, rising from her
        knees before the stove. &ldquo;Now it will be warm and bright enough; I can let
        the fire alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She closed the stove door with a bang, and approaching, assisted in
        removing Edna&rsquo;s dripping mackintosh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are cold; you look miserable. The chocolate will soon be hot. But
        would you rather have a taste of brandy? I have scarcely touched the
        bottle which you brought me for my cold.&rdquo; A piece of red flannel was
        wrapped around Mademoiselle&rsquo;s throat; a stiff neck compelled her to hold
        her head on one side.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will take some brandy,&rdquo; said Edna, shivering as she removed her gloves
        and overshoes. She drank the liquor from the glass as a man would have
        done. Then flinging herself upon the uncomfortable sofa she said,
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I am going to move away from my house on Esplanade Street.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated the musician, neither surprised nor especially
        interested. Nothing ever seemed to astonish her very much. She was
        endeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from its
        fastening in her hair. Edna drew her down upon the sofa, and taking a pin
        from her own hair, secured the shabby artificial flowers in their
        accustomed place.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you astonished?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Passably. Where are you going? to New York? to Iberville? to your father
        in Mississippi? where?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just two steps away,&rdquo; laughed Edna, &ldquo;in a little four-room house around
        the corner. It looks so cozy, so inviting and restful, whenever I pass by;
        and it&rsquo;s for rent. I&rsquo;m tired looking after that big house. It never seemed
        like mine, anyway&mdash;like home. It&rsquo;s too much trouble. I have to keep
        too many servants. I am tired bothering with them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is not your true reason, ma belle. There is no use in telling me
        lies. I don&rsquo;t know your reason, but you have not told me the truth.&rdquo; Edna
        did not protest or endeavor to justify herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The house, the money that provides for it, are not mine. Isn&rsquo;t that
        enough reason?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are your husband&rsquo;s,&rdquo; returned Mademoiselle, with a shrug and a
        malicious elevation of the eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I see there is no deceiving you. Then let me tell you: It is a
        caprice. I have a little money of my own from my mother&rsquo;s estate, which my
        father sends me by driblets. I won a large sum this winter on the races,
        and I am beginning to sell my sketches. Laidpore is more and more pleased
        with my work; he says it grows in force and individuality. I cannot judge
        of that myself, but I feel that I have gained in ease and confidence.
        However, as I said, I have sold a good many through Laidpore. I can live
        in the tiny house for little or nothing, with one servant. Old Celestine,
        who works occasionally for me, says she will come stay with me and do my
        work. I know I shall like it, like the feeling of freedom and
        independence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What does your husband say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not told him yet. I only thought of it this morning. He will think
        I am demented, no doubt. Perhaps you think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle shook her head slowly. &ldquo;Your reason is not yet clear to me,&rdquo;
        she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither was it quite clear to Edna herself; but it unfolded itself as she
        sat for a while in silence. Instinct had prompted her to put away her
        husband&rsquo;s bounty in casting off her allegiance. She did not know how it
        would be when he returned. There would have to be an understanding, an
        explanation. Conditions would some way adjust themselves, she felt; but
        whatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another than
        herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall give a grand dinner before I leave the old house!&rdquo; Edna
        exclaimed. &ldquo;You will have to come to it, Mademoiselle. I will give you
        everything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh and
        be merry for once.&rdquo; And she uttered a sigh that came from the very depths
        of her being.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Mademoiselle happened to have received a letter from Robert during the
        interval of Edna&rsquo;s visits, she would give her the letter unsolicited. And
        she would seat herself at the piano and play as her humor prompted her
        while the young woman read the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The little stove was roaring; it was red-hot, and the chocolate in the tin
        sizzled and sputtered. Edna went forward and opened the stove door, and
        Mademoiselle rising, took a letter from under the bust of Beethoven and
        handed it to Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Another! so soon!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes filled with delight. &ldquo;Tell me,
        Mademoiselle, does he know that I see his letters?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never in the world! He would be angry and would never write to me again
        if he thought so. Does he write to you? Never a line. Does he send you a
        message? Never a word. It is because he loves you, poor fool, and is
        trying to forget you, since you are not free to listen to him or to belong
        to him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you show me his letters, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you begged for them? Can I refuse you anything? Oh! you cannot
        deceive me,&rdquo; and Mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and began
        to play. Edna did not at once read the letter. She sat holding it in her
        hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an effulgence,
        warming and brightening the dark places of her soul. It prepared her for
        joy and exultation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. &ldquo;Why did you
        not tell me?&rdquo; She went and grasped Mademoiselle&rsquo;s hands up from the keys.
        &ldquo;Oh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That he was coming back? No great news, ma foi. I wonder he did not come
        long ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But when, when?&rdquo; cried Edna, impatiently. &ldquo;He does not say when.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He says &lsquo;very soon.&rsquo; You know as much about it as I do; it is all in the
        letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But why? Why is he coming? Oh, if I thought&mdash;&rdquo; and she snatched the
        letter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way, looking
        for the reason, which was left untold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If I were young and in love with a man,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle, turning on
        the stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked down
        at Edna, who sat on the floor holding the letter, &ldquo;it seems to me he would
        have to be some grand esprit; a man with lofty aims and ability to reach
        them; one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his fellow-men.
        It seems to me if I were young and in love I should never deem a man of
        ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me,
        Mademoiselle; or else you have never been in love, and know nothing about
        it. Why,&rdquo; went on Edna, clasping her knees and looking up into
        Mademoiselle&rsquo;s twisted face, &ldquo;do you suppose a woman knows why she loves?
        Does she select? Does she say to herself: &lsquo;Go to! Here is a distinguished
        statesman with presidential possibilities; I shall proceed to fall in love
        with him.&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;I shall set my heart upon this musician, whose fame is on
        every tongue?&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;This financier, who controls the world&rsquo;s money
        markets?&rsquo; 
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are purposely misunderstanding me, ma reine. Are you in love with
        Robert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edna. It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow
        overspread her face, blotching it with red spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked her companion. &ldquo;Why do you love him when you ought not to?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before
        Mademoiselle Reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why? Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples; because
        he opens and shuts his eyes, and his nose is a little out of drawing;
        because he has two lips and a square chin, and a little finger which he
        can&rsquo;t straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his
        youth. Because&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you do, in short,&rdquo; laughed Mademoiselle. &ldquo;What will you do when
        he comes back?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do? Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his
        return. The murky, lowering sky, which had depressed her a few hours
        before, seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the
        streets on her way home.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stopped at a confectioner&rsquo;s and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the
        children in Iberville. She slipped a card in the box, on which she
        scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her husband,
        telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house
        around the block, and to give a farewell dinner before leaving, regretting
        that he was not there to share it, to help out with the menu and assist
        her in entertaining the guests. Her letter was brilliant and brimming with
        cheerfulness.

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Arobin that evening. &ldquo;I never found
        you in such a happy mood.&rdquo; Edna was tired by that time, and was reclining
        on the lounge before the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun
        pretty soon?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that ought to be reason enough,&rdquo; he acquiesced. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t give
        me another if I sat here all night imploring you.&rdquo; He sat close to her on
        a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that
        fell a little over her forehead. She liked the touch of his fingers
        through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One of these days,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pull myself together for a
        while and think&mdash;try to determine what character of a woman I am;
        for, candidly, I don&rsquo;t know. By all the codes which I am acquainted with,
        I am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex. But some way I can&rsquo;t
        convince myself that I am. I must think about it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s the use? Why should you bother thinking about it when I can
        tell you what manner of woman you are.&rdquo; His fingers strayed occasionally
        down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was growing a little
        full and double.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes! You will tell me that I am adorable; everything that is
        captivating. Spare yourself the effort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I shan&rsquo;t tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn&rsquo;t be lying
        if I did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The pianist? I know her by sight. I&rsquo;ve heard her play.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don&rsquo;t notice
        at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, for instance, when I left her to-day, she put her arms around me
        and felt my shoulder blades, to see if my wings were strong, she said.
        &lsquo;The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice
        must have strong wings. It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings
        bruised, exhausted, fluttering back to earth.&rsquo; Whither would you soar?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of any extraordinary flights. I only half comprehend
        her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s partially demented,&rdquo; said Arobin.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She seems to me wonderfully sane,&rdquo; Edna replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told she&rsquo;s extremely disagreeable and unpleasant. Why have you
        introduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! talk of me if you like,&rdquo; cried Edna, clasping her hands beneath her
        head; &ldquo;but let me think of something else while you do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jealous of your thoughts tonight. They&rsquo;re making you a little kinder
        than usual; but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if they were
        not here with me.&rdquo; She only looked at him and smiled. His eyes were very
        near. He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across her, while the
        other hand still rested upon her hair. They continued silently to look
        into each other&rsquo;s eyes. When he leaned forward and kissed her, she clasped
        his head, holding his lips to hers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really
        responded. It was a flaming torch that kindled desire.

      <h2>

      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna cried a little that night after Arobin left her. It was only one
        phase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her. There was with
        her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility. There was the shock of
        the unexpected and the unaccustomed. There was her husband&rsquo;s reproach
        looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided
        for her external existence. There was Robert&rsquo;s reproach making itself felt
        by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had awakened within
        her toward him. Above all, there was understanding. She felt as if a mist
        had been lifted from her eyes, enabling her to took upon and comprehend
        the significance of life, that monster made up of beauty and brutality.
        But among the conflicting sensations which assailed her, there was neither
        shame nor remorse. There was a dull pang of regret because it was not the
        kiss of love which had inflamed her, because it was not love which had
        held this cup of life to her lips.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXIX
      </h2>
      <p>
        Without even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his opinion
        or wishes in the matter, Edna hastened her preparations for quitting her
        home on Esplanade Street and moving into the little house around the
        block. A feverish anxiety attended her every action in that direction.
        There was no moment of deliberation, no interval of repose between the
        thought and its fulfillment. Early upon the morning following those hours
        passed in Arobin&rsquo;s society, Edna set about securing her new abode and
        hurrying her arrangements for occupying it. Within the precincts of her
        home she felt like one who has entered and lingered within the portals of
        some forbidden temple in which a thousand muffled voices bade her begone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever was her own in the house, everything which she had acquired aside
        from her husband&rsquo;s bounty, she caused to be transported to the other
        house, supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arobin found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the
        house-maid when he looked in during the afternoon. She was splendid and
        robust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with a
        red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her
        hair from the dust. She was mounted upon a high stepladder, unhooking a
        picture from the wall when he entered. He had found the front door open,
        and had followed his ring by walking in unceremoniously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you want to kill yourself?&rdquo; She greeted him with
        affected carelessness, and appeared absorbed in her occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he had expected to find her languishing, reproachful, or indulging in
        sentimental tears, he must have been greatly surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was no doubt prepared for any emergency, ready for any one of the
        foregoing attitudes, just as he bent himself easily and naturally to the
        situation which confronted him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Please come down,&rdquo; he insisted, holding the ladder and looking up at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;Ellen is afraid to mount the ladder. Joe is working
        over at the &lsquo;pigeon house&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name Ellen gives it, because
        it&rsquo;s so small and looks like a pigeon house&mdash;and some one has to do
        this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Arobin pulled off his coat, and expressed himself ready and willing to
        tempt fate in her place. Ellen brought him one of her dust-caps, and went
        into contortions of mirth, which she found it impossible to control, when
        she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as he could. Edna
        herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened it at his
        request. So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder, unhooking pictures
        and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as Edna directed. When he had
        finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to wash his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather
        duster along the carpet when he came in again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there anything more you will let me do?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Ellen can manage the rest.&rdquo; She kept the
        young woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone with
        Arobin.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What about the dinner?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;the grand event, the coup d&rsquo;etat?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be day after to-morrow. Why do you call it the &lsquo;coup d&rsquo;etat?&rsquo; Oh!
        it will be very fine; all my best of everything&mdash;crystal, silver and
        gold, Sevres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. I&rsquo;ll let Leonce
        pay the bills. I wonder what he&rsquo;ll say when he sees the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you ask me why I call it a coup d&rsquo;etat?&rdquo; Arobin had put on his coat,
        and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb. She told him it
        was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When do you go to the &lsquo;pigeon house?&rsquo;&mdash;with all due acknowledgment
        to Ellen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Day after to-morrow, after the dinner. I shall sleep there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ellen, will you very kindly get me a glass of water?&rdquo; asked Arobin. &ldquo;The
        dust in the curtains, if you will pardon me for hinting such a thing, has
        parched my throat to a crisp.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;While Ellen gets the water,&rdquo; said Edna, rising, &ldquo;I will say good-by and
        let you go. I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million things to
        do and think of.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When shall I see you?&rdquo; asked Arobin, seeking to detain her, the maid
        having left the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the dinner, of course. You are invited.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not before?&mdash;not to-night or to-morrow morning or tomorrow noon or
        night? or the day after morning or noon? Can&rsquo;t you see yourself, without
        my telling you, what an eternity it is?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway, looking
        up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not an instant sooner,&rdquo; she said. But she laughed and looked at him with
        eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to wait.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Though Edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair, it was in
        truth a very small affair and very select, in so much as the guests
        invited were few and were selected with discrimination. She had counted
        upon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board,
        forgetting for the moment that Madame Ratignolle was to the last degree
        souffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that Madame Lebrun would
        send a thousand regrets at the last moment. So there were only ten, after
        all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were Mr. and Mrs. Merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in the
        thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate, who
        laughed a good deal at other people&rsquo;s witticisms, and had thereby made
        himself extremely popular. Mrs. Highcamp had accompanied them. Of course,
        there was Alcee Arobin; and Mademoiselle Reisz had consented to come. Edna
        had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace trimmings for her
        hair. Monsieur Ratignolle brought himself and his wife&rsquo;s excuses. Victor
        Lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon relaxation, had accepted
        with alacrity. There was a Miss Mayblunt, no longer in her teens, who
        looked at the world through lorgnettes and with the keenest interest. It
        was thought and said that she was intellectual; it was suspected of her
        that she wrote under a nom de guerre. She had come with a gentleman by the
        name of Gouvernail, connected with one of the daily papers, of whom
        nothing special could be said, except that he was observant and seemed
        quiet and inoffensive. Edna herself made the tenth, and at half-past eight
        they seated themselves at table, Arobin and Monsieur Ratignolle on either
        side of their hostess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Highcamp sat between Arobin and Victor Lebrun. Then came Mrs.
        Merriman, Mr. Gouvernail, Miss Mayblunt, Mr. Merriman, and Mademoiselle
        Reisz next to Monsieur Ratignolle.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the table,
        an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin under
        strips of lace-work. There were wax candles, in massive brass candelabra,
        burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant roses, yellow and
        red, abounded. There were silver and gold, as she had said there would be,
        and crystal which glittered like the gems which the women wore.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and
        replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected
        throughout the house. Mademoiselle Reisz, being exceedingly diminutive,
        was elevated upon cushions, as small children are sometimes hoisted at
        table upon bulky volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Something new, Edna?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Mayblunt, with lorgnette directed
        toward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled, that almost
        sputtered, in Edna&rsquo;s hair, just over the center of her forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite new; &lsquo;brand&rsquo; new, in fact; a present from my husband. It arrived
        this morning from New York. I may as well admit that this is my birthday,
        and that I am twenty-nine. In good time I expect you to drink my health.
        Meanwhile, I shall ask you to begin with this cocktail, composed&mdash;would
        you say &lsquo;composed?&rsquo;&rdquo; with an appeal to Miss Mayblunt&mdash;&ldquo;composed by my
        father in honor of Sister Janet&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a
        garnet gem.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, all things considered,&rdquo; spoke Arobin, &ldquo;it might not be amiss to
        start out by drinking the Colonel&rsquo;s health in the cocktail which he
        composed, on the birthday of the most charming of women&mdash;the daughter
        whom he invented.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Merriman&rsquo;s laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so
        contagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never
        slackened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miss Mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before
        her, just to look at. The color was marvelous! She could compare it to
        nothing she had ever seen, and the garnet lights which it emitted were
        unspeakably rare. She pronounced the Colonel an artist, and stuck to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monsieur Ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously; the mets, the
        entre-mets, the service, the decorations, even the people. He looked up
        from his pompano and inquired of Arobin if he were related to the
        gentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of Laitner and Arobin,
        lawyers. The young man admitted that Laitner was a warm personal friend,
        who permitted Arobin&rsquo;s name to decorate the firm&rsquo;s letterheads and to
        appear upon a shingle that graced Perdido Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding,&rdquo; said
        Arobin, &ldquo;that one is really forced as a matter of convenience these days
        to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not.&rdquo; Monsieur
        Ratignolle stared a little, and turned to ask Mademoiselle Reisz if she
        considered the symphony concerts up to the standard which had been set the
        previous winter. Mademoiselle Reisz answered Monsieur Ratignolle in
        French, which Edna thought a little rude, under the circumstances, but
        characteristic. Mademoiselle had only disagreeable things to say of the
        symphony concerts, and insulting remarks to make of all the musicians of
        New Orleans, singly and collectively. All her interest seemed to be
        centered upon the delicacies placed before her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Merriman said that Mr. Arobin&rsquo;s remark about inquisitive people
        reminded him of a man from Waco the other day at the St. Charles Hotel&mdash;but
        as Mr. Merriman&rsquo;s stories were always lame and lacking point, his wife
        seldom permitted him to complete them. She interrupted him to ask if he
        remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought the week
        before to send to a friend in Geneva. She was talking &ldquo;books&rdquo; with Mr.
        Gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current literary
        topics. Her husband told the story of the Waco man privately to Miss
        Mayblunt, who pretended to be greatly amused and to think it extremely
        clever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm and
        impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, Victor Lebrun. Her
        attention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating herself
        at table; and when he turned to Mrs. Merriman, who was prettier and more
        vivacious than Mrs. Highcamp, she waited with easy indifference for an
        opportunity to reclaim his attention. There was the occasional sound of
        music, of mandolins, sufficiently removed to be an agreeable accompaniment
        rather than an interruption to the conversation. Outside the soft,
        monotonous splash of a fountain could be heard; the sound penetrated into
        the room with the heavy odor of jessamine that came through the open
        windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden shimmer of Edna&rsquo;s satin gown spread in rich folds on either
        side of her. There was a soft fall of lace encircling her shoulders. It
        was the color of her skin, without the glow, the myriad living tints that
        one may sometimes discover in vibrant flesh. There was something in her
        attitude, in her whole appearance when she leaned her head against the
        high-backed chair and spread her arms, which suggested the regal woman,
        the one who rules, who looks on, who stands alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as she sat there amid her guests, she felt the old ennui overtaking
        her; the hopelessness which so often assailed her, which came upon her
        like an obsession, like something extraneous, independent of volition. It
        was something which announced itself; a chill breath that seemed to issue
        from some vast cavern wherein discords waited. There came over her the
        acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the presence
        of the beloved one, overpowering her at once with a sense of the
        unattainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moments glided on, while a feeling of good fellowship passed around
        the circle like a mystic cord, holding and binding these people together
        with jest and laughter. Monsieur Ratignolle was the first to break the
        pleasant charm. At ten o&rsquo;clock he excused himself. Madame Ratignolle was
        waiting for him at home. She was bien souffrante, and she was filled with
        vague dread, which only her husband&rsquo;s presence could allay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mademoiselle Reisz arose with Monsieur Ratignolle, who offered to escort
        her to the car. She had eaten well; she had tasted the good, rich wines,
        and they must have turned her head, for she bowed pleasantly to all as she
        withdrew from table. She kissed Edna upon the shoulder, and whispered:
        &ldquo;Bonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage.&rdquo; She had been a little bewildered upon
        rising, or rather, descending from her cushions, and Monsieur Ratignolle
        gallantly took her arm and led her away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Highcamp was weaving a garland of roses, yellow and red. When she had
        finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon Victor&rsquo;s black curls. He
        was reclining far back in the luxurious chair, holding a glass of
        champagne to the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if a magician&rsquo;s wand had touched him, the garland of roses transformed
        him into a vision of Oriental beauty. His cheeks were the color of crushed
        grapes, and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sapristi!&rdquo; exclaimed Arobin.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Mrs. Highcamp had one more touch to add to the picture. She took from
        the back of her chair a white silken scarf, with which she had covered her
        shoulders in the early part of the evening. She draped it across the boy
        in graceful folds, and in a way to conceal his black, conventional evening
        dress. He did not seem to mind what she did to him, only smiled, showing a
        faint gleam of white teeth, while he continued to gaze with narrowing eyes
        at the light through his glass of champagne.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! to be able to paint in color rather than in words!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
        Mayblunt, losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;There was a graven image of Desire Painted with red blood on a ground of
        gold.&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured Gouvernail, under his breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of the wine upon Victor was to change his accustomed volubility
        into silence. He seemed to have abandoned himself to a reverie, and to be
        seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sing,&rdquo; entreated Mrs. Highcamp. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing to us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said Arobin.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s posing,&rdquo; offered Mr. Merriman; &ldquo;let him have it out.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s paralyzed,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Merriman. And leaning over the
        youth&rsquo;s chair, she took the glass from his hand and held it to his lips.
        He sipped the wine slowly, and when he had drained the glass she laid it
        upon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing for you,&rdquo; he said, turning in his chair toward Mrs.
        Highcamp. He clasped his hands behind his head, and looking up at the
        ceiling began to hum a little, trying his voice like a musician tuning an
        instrument. Then, looking at Edna, he began to sing:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ah! si tu savais!&rdquo;
 </pre>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sing that. I don&rsquo;t want you to sing it,&rdquo; and she
        laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to shatter it
        against a carafe. The wine spilled over Arobin&rsquo;s legs and some of it
        trickled down upon Mrs. Highcamp&rsquo;s black gauze gown. Victor had lost all
        idea of courtesy, or else he thought his hostess was not in earnest, for
        he laughed and went on:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ah! si tu savais

```

```

</pre>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t! you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exclaimed Edna, and pushing back her chair
        she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth. He kissed
        the soft palm that pressed upon his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t, Mrs. Pontellier. I didn&rsquo;t know you meant it,&rdquo; looking up
        at her with caressing eyes. The touch of his lips was like a pleasing
        sting to her hand. She lifted the garland of roses from his head and flung
        it across the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, Victor; you&rsquo;ve posed long enough. Give Mrs. Highcamp her scarf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Highcamp undraped the scarf from about him with her own hands. Miss
        Mayblunt and Mr. Gouvernail suddenly conceived the notion that it was time
        to say good night. And Mr. and Mrs. Merriman wondered how it could be so
        late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before parting from Victor, Mrs. Highcamp invited him to call upon her
        daughter, who she knew would be charmed to meet him and talk French and
        sing French songs with him. Victor expressed his desire and intention to
        call upon Miss Highcamp at the first opportunity which presented itself.
        He asked if Arobin were going his way. Arobin was not.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mandolin players had long since stolen away. A profound stillness had
        fallen upon the broad, beautiful street. The voices of Edna&rsquo;s disbanding
        guests jarred like a discordant note upon the quiet harmony of the night.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXI
      </h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Arobin, who had remained with Edna after the others had
        departed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she reiterated, and stood up, stretching her arms, and feeling the
        need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The servants are all gone. They left when the musicians did. I have
        dismissed them. The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot
        around to the pigeon house, and shall send Celestine over in the morning
        to straighten things up.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked around, and began to turn out some of the lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What about upstairs?&rdquo; he inquired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it is all right; but there may be a window or two unlatched. We
        had better look; you might take a candle and see. And bring me my wrap and
        hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He went up with the light, and Edna began closing doors and windows. She
        hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine. Arobin found her
        cape and hat, which he brought down and helped her to put on.
      </p>
      <p>
        When everything was secured and the lights put out, they left through the
        front door, Arobin locking it and taking the key, which he carried for
        Edna. He helped her down the steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you have a spray of jessamine?&rdquo; he asked, breaking off a few
        blossoms as he passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She seemed disheartened, and had nothing to say. She took his arm, which
        he offered her, holding up the weight of her satin train with the other
        hand. She looked down, noticing the black line of his leg moving in and
        out so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown. There was the
        whistle of a railway train somewhere in the distance, and the midnight
        bells were ringing. They met no one in their short walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &ldquo;pigeon house&rdquo; stood behind a locked gate, and a shallow parterre that
        had been somewhat neglected. There was a small front porch, upon which a
        long window and the front door opened. The door opened directly into the
        parlor; there was no side entry. Back in the yard was a room for servants,
        in which old Celestine had been ensconced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna had left a lamp burning low upon the table. She had succeeded in
        making the room look habitable and homelike. There were some books on the
        table and a lounge near at hand. On the floor was a fresh matting, covered
        with a rug or two; and on the walls hung a few tasteful pictures. But the
        room was filled with flowers. These were a surprise to her. Arobin had
        sent them, and had had Celestine distribute them during Edna&rsquo;s absence.
        Her bedroom was adjoining, and across a small passage were the dining-room
        and kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and chilled, and miserable. I feel as if I had been wound up to a
        certain pitch&mdash;too tight&mdash;and something inside of me had
        snapped.&rdquo; She rested her head against the table upon her bare arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You want to rest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to be quiet. I&rsquo;ll go; I&rsquo;ll leave you and
        let you rest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft, magnetic hand.
        His touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort. She could have
        fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand over her
        hair. He brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope you will feel better and happier in the morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
        have tried to do too much in the past few days. The dinner was the last
        straw; you might have dispensed with it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;it was stupid.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it was delightful; but it has worn you out.&rdquo; His hand had strayed to
        her beautiful shoulders, and he could feel the response of her flesh to
        his touch. He seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon the
        shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought you were going away,&rdquo; she said, in an uneven voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am, after I have said good night.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she murmured.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did not answer, except to continue to caress her. He did not say good
        night until she had become supple to his gentle, seductive entreaties.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXII
      </h2>
      <p>
        When Mr. Pontellier learned of his wife&rsquo;s intention to abandon her home
        and take up her residence elsewhere, he immediately wrote her a letter of
        unqualified disapproval and remonstrance. She had given reasons which he
        was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate. He hoped she had not acted upon
        her rash impulse; and he begged her to consider first, foremost, and above
        all else, what people would say. He was not dreaming of scandal when he
        uttered this warning; that was a thing which would never have entered into
        his mind to consider in connection with his wife&rsquo;s name or his own. He was
        simply thinking of his financial integrity. It might get noised about that
        the Pontelliers had met with reverses, and were forced to conduct their
        menage on a humbler scale than heretofore. It might do incalculable
        mischief to his business prospects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But remembering Edna&rsquo;s whimsical turn of mind of late, and foreseeing that
        she had immediately acted upon her impetuous determination, he grasped the
        situation with his usual promptness and handled it with his well-known
        business tact and cleverness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same mail which brought to Edna his letter of disapproval carried
        instructions&mdash;the most minute instructions&mdash;to a well-known
        architect concerning the remodeling of his home, changes which he had long
        contemplated, and which he desired carried forward during his temporary
        absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expert and reliable packers and movers were engaged to convey the
        furniture, carpets, pictures&mdash;everything movable, in short&mdash;to
        places of security. And in an incredibly short time the Pontellier house
        was turned over to the artisans. There was to be an addition&mdash;a small
        snuggery; there was to be frescoing, and hardwood flooring was to be put
        into such rooms as had not yet been subjected to this improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, in one of the daily papers appeared a brief notice to the
        effect that Mr. and Mrs. Pontellier were contemplating a summer sojourn
        abroad, and that their handsome residence on Esplanade Street was
        undergoing sumptuous alterations, and would not be ready for occupancy
        until their return. Mr. Pontellier had saved appearances!
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna admired the skill of his maneuver, and avoided any occasion to balk
        his intentions. When the situation as set forth by Mr. Pontellier was
        accepted and taken for granted, she was apparently satisfied that it
        should be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pigeon house pleased her. It at once assumed the intimate character of
        a home, while she herself invested it with a charm which it reflected like
        a warm glow. There was with her a feeling of having descended in the
        social scale, with a corresponding sense of having risen in the spiritual.
        Every step which she took toward relieving herself from obligations added
        to her strength and expansion as an individual. She began to look with her
        own eyes; to see and to apprehend the deeper undercurrents of life. No
        longer was she content to &ldquo;feed upon opinion&rdquo; when her own soul had
        invited her.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a little while, a few days, in fact, Edna went up and spent a week
        with her children in Iberville. They were delicious February days, with
        all the summer&rsquo;s promise hovering in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        How glad she was to see the children! She wept for very pleasure when she
        felt their little arms clasping her; their hard, ruddy cheeks pressed
        against her own glowing cheeks. She looked into their faces with hungry
        eyes that could not be satisfied with looking. And what stories they had
        to tell their mother! About the pigs, the cows, the mules! About riding to
        the mill behind Gluglu; fishing back in the lake with their Uncle Jasper;
        picking pecans with Lidie&rsquo;s little black brood, and hauling chips in their
        express wagon. It was a thousand times more fun to haul real chips for old
        lame Susie&rsquo;s real fire than to drag painted blocks along the banquette on
        Esplanade Street!
      </p>
      <p>
        She went with them herself to see the pigs and the cows, to look at the
        darkies laying the cane, to thrash the pecan trees, and catch fish in the
        back lake. She lived with them a whole week long, giving them all of
        herself, and gathering and filling herself with their young existence.
        They listened, breathless, when she told them the house in Esplanade
        Street was crowded with workmen, hammering, nailing, sawing, and filling
        the place with clatter. They wanted to know where their bed was; what had
        been done with their rocking-horse; and where did Joe sleep, and where had
        Ellen gone, and the cook? But, above all, they were fired with a desire to
        see the little house around the block. Was there any place to play? Were
        there any boys next door? Raoul, with pessimistic foreboding, was
        convinced that there were only girls next door. Where would they sleep,
        and where would papa sleep? She told them the fairies would fix it all
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old Madame was charmed with Edna&rsquo;s visit, and showered all manner of
        delicate attentions upon her. She was delighted to know that the Esplanade
        Street house was in a dismantled condition. It gave her the promise and
        pretext to keep the children indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was with a wrench and a pang that Edna left her children. She carried
        away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks. All
        along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the
        memory of a delicious song. But by the time she had regained the city the
        song no longer echoed in her soul. She was again alone.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        It happened sometimes when Edna went to see Mademoiselle Reisz that the
        little musician was absent, giving a lesson or making some small necessary
        household purchase. The key was always left in a secret hiding-place in
        the entry, which Edna knew. If Mademoiselle happened to be away, Edna
        would usually enter and wait for her return.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s door one afternoon there was no
        response; so unlocking the door, as usual, she entered and found the
        apartment deserted, as she had expected. Her day had been quite filled up,
        and it was for a rest, for a refuge, and to talk about Robert, that she
        sought out her friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had worked at her canvas&mdash;a young Italian character study&mdash;all
        the morning, completing the work without the model; but there had been
        many interruptions, some incident to her modest housekeeping, and others
        of a social nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Ratignolle had dragged herself over, avoiding the too public
        thoroughfares, she said. She complained that Edna had neglected her much
        of late. Besides, she was consumed with curiosity to see the little house
        and the manner in which it was conducted. She wanted to hear all about the
        dinner party; Monsieur Ratignolle had left so early. What had happened
        after he left? The champagne and grapes which Edna sent over were TOO
        delicious. She had so little appetite; they had refreshed and toned her
        stomach. Where on earth was she going to put Mr. Pontellier in that little
        house, and the boys? And then she made Edna promise to go to her when her
        hour of trial overtook her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At any time&mdash;any time of the day or night, dear,&rdquo; Edna assured her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before leaving Madame Ratignolle said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In some way you seem to me like a child, Edna. You seem to act without a
        certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life. That is the
        reason I want to say you mustn&rsquo;t mind if I advise you to be a little
        careful while you are living here alone. Why don&rsquo;t you have some one come
        and stay with you? Wouldn&rsquo;t Mademoiselle Reisz come?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; she wouldn&rsquo;t wish to come, and I shouldn&rsquo;t want her always with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, the reason&mdash;you know how evil-minded the world is&mdash;some
        one was talking of Alcee Arobin visiting you. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t
        matter if Mr. Arobin had not such a dreadful reputation. Monsieur
        Ratignolle was telling me that his attentions alone are considered enough
        to ruin a woman&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does he boast of his successes?&rdquo; asked Edna, indifferently, squinting at
        her picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I think not. I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes. But
        his character is so well known among the men. I shan&rsquo;t be able to come
        back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to-day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mind the step!&rdquo; cried Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t neglect me,&rdquo; entreated Madame Ratignolle; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t mind what I
        said about Arobin, or having some one to stay with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Edna laughed. &ldquo;You may say anything you like to me.&rdquo; They
        kissed each other good-by. Madame Ratignolle had not far to go, and Edna
        stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then in the afternoon Mrs. Merriman and Mrs. Highcamp had made their
        &ldquo;party call.&rdquo; Edna felt that they might have dispensed with the formality.
        They had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one evening at Mrs.
        Merriman&rsquo;s. She was asked to go early, to dinner, and Mr. Merriman or Mr.
        Arobin would take her home. Edna accepted in a half-hearted way. She
        sometimes felt very tired of Mrs. Highcamp and Mrs. Merriman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late in the afternoon she sought refuge with Mademoiselle Reisz, and
        stayed there alone, waiting for her, feeling a kind of repose invade her
        with the very atmosphere of the shabby, unpretentious little room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna sat at the window, which looked out over the house-tops and across
        the river. The window frame was filled with pots of flowers, and she sat
        and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium. The day was warm, and the
        breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant. She removed her hat
        and laid it on the piano. She went on picking the leaves and digging
        around the plants with her hat pin. Once she thought she heard
        Mademoiselle Reisz approaching. But it was a young black girl, who came
        in, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the
        adjoining room, and went away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna seated herself at the piano, and softly picked out with one hand the
        bars of a piece of music which lay open before her. A half-hour went by.
        There was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the lower
        hall. She was growing interested in her occupation of picking out the
        aria, when there was a second rap at the door. She vaguely wondered what
        these people did when they found Mademoiselle&rsquo;s door locked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called, turning her face toward the door. And this time it
        was Robert Lebrun who presented himself. She attempted to rise; she could
        not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered her at
        sight of him, so she fell back upon the stool, only exclaiming, &ldquo;Why,
        Robert!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He came and clasped her hand, seemingly without knowing what he was saying
        or doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mrs. Pontellier! How do you happen&mdash;oh! how well you look! Is
        Mademoiselle Reisz not here? I never expected to see you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When did you come back?&rdquo; asked Edna in an unsteady voice, wiping her face
        with her handkerchief. She seemed ill at ease on the piano stool, and he
        begged her to take the chair by the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        She did so, mechanically, while he seated himself on the stool.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I returned day before yesterday,&rdquo; he answered, while he leaned his arm on
        the keys, bringing forth a crash of discordant sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Day before yesterday!&rdquo; she repeated, aloud; and went on thinking to
        herself, &ldquo;day before yesterday,&rdquo; in a sort of an uncomprehending way. She
        had pictured him seeking her at the very first hour, and he had lived
        under the same sky since day before yesterday; while only by accident had
        he stumbled upon her. Mademoiselle must have lied when she said, &ldquo;Poor
        fool, he loves you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Day before yesterday,&rdquo; she repeated, breaking off a spray of
        Mademoiselle&rsquo;s geranium; &ldquo;then if you had not met me here to-day you
        wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;when&mdash;that is, didn&rsquo;t you mean to come and see me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course, I should have gone to see you. There have been so many things&mdash;&rdquo;
        he turned the leaves of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s music nervously. &ldquo;I started in at
        once yesterday with the old firm. After all there is as much chance for me
        here as there was there&mdash;that is, I might find it profitable some
        day. The Mexicans were not very congenial.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So he had come back because the Mexicans were not congenial; because
        business was as profitable here as there; because of any reason, and not
        because he cared to be near her. She remembered the day she sat on the
        floor, turning the pages of his letter, seeking the reason which was left
        untold.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had not noticed how he looked&mdash;only feeling his presence; but she
        turned deliberately and observed him. After all, he had been absent but a
        few months, and was not changed. His hair&mdash;the color of hers&mdash;waved
        back from his temples in the same way as before. His skin was not more
        burned than it had been at Grand Isle. She found in his eyes, when he
        looked at her for one silent moment, the same tender caress, with an added
        warmth and entreaty which had not been there before the same glance which
        had penetrated to the sleeping places of her soul and awakened them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hundred times Edna had pictured Robert&rsquo;s return, and imagined their
        first meeting. It was usually at her home, whither he had sought her out
        at once. She always fancied him expressing or betraying in some way his
        love for her. And here, the reality was that they sat ten feet apart, she
        at the window, crushing geranium leaves in her hand and smelling them, he
        twirling around on the piano stool, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was very much surprised to hear of Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s absence; it&rsquo;s a
        wonder Mademoiselle Reisz did not tell me; and your moving&mdash;mother
        told me yesterday. I should think you would have gone to New York with
        him, or to Iberville with the children, rather than be bothered here with
        housekeeping. And you are going abroad, too, I hear. We shan&rsquo;t have you at
        Grand Isle next summer; it won&rsquo;t seem&mdash;do you see much of
        Mademoiselle Reisz? She often spoke of you in the few letters she wrote.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you remember that you promised to write to me when you went away?&rdquo; A
        flush overspread his whole face.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe that my letters would be of any interest to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is an excuse; it isn&rsquo;t the truth.&rdquo; Edna reached for her hat on the
        piano. She adjusted it, sticking the hat pin through the heavy coil of
        hair with some deliberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you not going to wait for Mademoiselle Reisz?&rdquo; asked Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I have found when she is absent this long, she is liable not to come
        back till late.&rdquo; She drew on her gloves, and Robert picked up his hat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you wait for her?&rdquo; asked Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not if you think she will not be back till late,&rdquo; adding, as if suddenly
        aware of some discourtesy in his speech, &ldquo;and I should miss the pleasure
        of walking home with you.&rdquo; Edna locked the door and put the key back in
        its hiding-place.
      </p>
      <p>
        They went together, picking their way across muddy streets and sidewalks
        encumbered with the cheap display of small tradesmen. Part of the distance
        they rode in the car, and after disembarking, passed the Pontellier
        mansion, which looked broken and half torn asunder. Robert had never known
        the house, and looked at it with interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I never knew you in your home,&rdquo; he remarked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am glad you did not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She did not answer. They went on around the corner, and it seemed
        as if her dreams were coming true after all, when he followed her into the
        little house.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must stay and dine with me, Robert. You see I am all alone, and it is
        so long since I have seen you. There is so much I want to ask you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She took off her hat and gloves. He stood irresolute, making some excuse
        about his mother who expected him; he even muttered something about an
        engagement. She struck a match and lit the lamp on the table; it was
        growing dusk. When he saw her face in the lamp-light, looking pained, with
        all the soft lines gone out of it, he threw his hat aside and seated
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! you know I want to stay if you will let me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. All the
        softness came back. She laughed, and went and put her hand on his
        shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is the first moment you have seemed like the old Robert. I&rsquo;ll go
        tell Celestine.&rdquo; She hurried away to tell Celestine to set an extra place.
        She even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which she had not
        thought of for herself. And she recommended great care in dripping the
        coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she reentered, Robert was turning over magazines, sketches, and
        things that lay upon the table in great disorder. He picked up a
        photograph, and exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alcee Arobin! What on earth is his picture doing here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tried to make a sketch of his head one day,&rdquo; answered Edna, &ldquo;and he
        thought the photograph might help me. It was at the other house. I thought
        it had been left there. I must have packed it up with my drawing
        materials.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I have a great many such photographs. I never think of returning
        them. They don&rsquo;t amount to anything.&rdquo; Robert kept on looking at the
        picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;do you think his head worth drawing? Is he a friend
        of Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s? You never said you knew him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a friend of Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s; he&rsquo;s a friend of mine. I always
        knew him&mdash;that is, it is only of late that I know him pretty well.
        But I&rsquo;d rather talk about you, and know what you have been seeing and
        doing and feeling out there in Mexico.&rdquo; Robert threw aside the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the quiet,
        grassy street of the Cheniere; the old fort at Grande Terre. I&rsquo;ve been
        working like a machine, and feeling like a lost soul. There was nothing
        interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She leaned her head upon her hand to shade her eyes from the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what have you been seeing and doing and feeling all these days?&rdquo; he
        asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the quiet,
        grassy street of the Cheniere Caminada; the old sunny fort at Grande
        Terre. I&rsquo;ve been working with a little more comprehension than a machine,
        and still feeling like a lost soul. There was nothing interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mrs. Pontellier, you are cruel,&rdquo; he said, with feeling, closing his eyes
        and resting his head back in his chair. They remained in silence till old
        Celestine announced dinner.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXIV
      </h2>
      <p>
        The dining-room was very small. Edna&rsquo;s round mahogany would have almost
        filled it. As it was there was but a step or two from the little table to
        the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that
        opened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.
      </p>
      <p>
        A certain degree of ceremony settled upon them with the announcement of
        dinner. There was no return to personalities. Robert related incidents of
        his sojourn in Mexico, and Edna talked of events likely to interest him,
        which had occurred during his absence. The dinner was of ordinary quality,
        except for the few delicacies which she had sent out to purchase. Old
        Celestine, with a bandana tignon twisted about her head, hobbled in and
        out, taking a personal interest in everything; and she lingered
        occasionally to talk patois with Robert, whom she had known as a boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        He went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers, and
        when he came back he found that Celestine had served the black coffee in
        the parlor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have come back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you are tired of me,
        tell me to go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You never tire me. You must have forgotten the hours and hours at Grand
        Isle in which we grew accustomed to each other and used to being
        together.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have forgotten nothing at Grand Isle,&rdquo; he said, not looking at her, but
        rolling a cigarette. His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the table, was
        a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork of a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch,&rdquo; said Edna, picking up
        the pouch and examining the needlework.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; it was lost.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where did you buy this one? In Mexico?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was given to me by a Vera Cruz girl; they are very generous,&rdquo; he
        replied, striking a match and lighting his cigarette.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are very handsome, I suppose, those Mexican women; very picturesque,
        with their black eyes and their lace scarfs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Some are; others are hideous, just as you find women everywhere.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What was she like&mdash;the one who gave you the pouch? You must have
        known her very well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She was very ordinary. She wasn&rsquo;t of the slightest importance. I knew her
        well enough.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you visit at her house? Was it interesting? I should like to know and
        hear about the people you met, and the impressions they made on you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the imprint
        of an oar upon the water.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was she such a one?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be ungenerous for me to admit that she was of that order and
        kind.&rdquo; He thrust the pouch back in his pocket, as if to put away the
        subject with the trifle which had brought it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arobin dropped in with a message from Mrs. Merriman, to say that the card
        party was postponed on account of the illness of one of her children.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you do, Arobin?&rdquo; said Robert, rising from the obscurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! Lebrun. To be sure! I heard yesterday you were back. How did they
        treat you down in Mexique?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fairly well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But not well enough to keep you there. Stunning girls, though, in Mexico.
        I thought I should never get away from Vera Cruz when I was down there a
        couple of years ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and things
        for you?&rdquo; asked Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! my! no! I didn&rsquo;t get so deep in their regard. I fear they made more
        impression on me than I made on them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were less fortunate than Robert, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am always less fortunate than Robert. Has he been imparting tender
        confidences?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been imposing myself long enough,&rdquo; said Robert, rising, and shaking
        hands with Edna. &ldquo;Please convey my regards to Mr. Pontellier when you
        write.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He shook hands with Arobin and went away.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fine fellow, that Lebrun,&rdquo; said Arobin when Robert had gone. &ldquo;I never
        heard you speak of him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I knew him last summer at Grand Isle,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Here is that
        photograph of yours. Don&rsquo;t you want it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do I want with it? Throw it away.&rdquo; She threw it back on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to Mrs. Merriman&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you see her, tell her
        so. But perhaps I had better write. I think I shall write now, and say
        that I am sorry her child is sick, and tell her not to count on me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be a good scheme,&rdquo; acquiesced Arobin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you; stupid
        lot!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna opened the blotter, and having procured paper and pen, began to write
        the note. Arobin lit a cigar and read the evening paper, which he had in
        his pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the date?&rdquo; she asked. He told her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you mail this for me when you go out?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; He read to her little bits out of the newspaper, while she
        straightened things on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo; he asked, throwing aside the paper. &ldquo;Do you want
        to go out for a walk or a drive or anything? It would be a fine night to
        drive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want to do anything but just be quiet. You go away and amuse
        yourself. Don&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away if I must; but I shan&rsquo;t amuse myself. You know that I only
        live when I am near you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He stood up to bid her good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is that one of the things you always say to women?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have said it before, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever came so near meaning it,&rdquo;
        he answered with a smile. There were no warm lights in her eyes; only a
        dreamy, absent look.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good night. I adore you. Sleep well,&rdquo; he said, and he kissed her hand and
        went away.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stayed alone in a kind of reverie&mdash;a sort of stupor. Step by step
        she lived over every instant of the time she had been with Robert after he
        had entered Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s door. She recalled his words, his looks.
        How few and meager they had been for her hungry heart! A vision&mdash;a
        transcendently seductive vision of a Mexican girl arose before her. She
        writhed with a jealous pang. She wondered when he would come back. He had
        not said he would come back. She had been with him, had heard his voice
        and touched his hand. But some way he had seemed nearer to her off there
        in Mexico.

      <p>
        The morning was full of sunlight and hope. Edna could see before her no
        denial&mdash;only the promise of excessive joy. She lay in bed awake, with
        bright eyes full of speculation. &ldquo;He loves you, poor fool.&rdquo; If she could
        but get that conviction firmly fixed in her mind, what mattered about the
        rest? She felt she had been childish and unwise the night before in giving
        herself over to despondency. She recapitulated the motives which no doubt
        explained Robert&rsquo;s reserve. They were not insurmountable; they would not
        hold if he really loved her; they could not hold against her own passion,
        which he must come to realize in time. She pictured him going to his
        business that morning. She even saw how he was dressed; how he walked down
        one street, and turned the corner of another; saw him bending over his
        desk, talking to people who entered the office, going to his lunch, and
        perhaps watching for her on the street. He would come to her in the
        afternoon or evening, sit and roll his cigarette, talk a little, and go
        away as he had done the night before. But how delicious it would be to
        have him there with her! She would have no regrets, nor seek to penetrate
        his reserve if he still chose to wear it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna ate her breakfast only half dressed. The maid brought her a delicious
        printed scrawl from Raoul, expressing his love, asking her to send him
        some bonbons, and telling her they had found that morning ten tiny white
        pigs all lying in a row beside Lidie&rsquo;s big white pig.
      </p>
      <p>
        A letter also came from her husband, saying he hoped to be back early in
        March, and then they would get ready for that journey abroad which he had
        promised her so long, which he felt now fully able to afford; he felt able
        to travel as people should, without any thought of small economies&mdash;thanks
        to his recent speculations in Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much to her surprise she received a note from Arobin, written at midnight
        from the club. It was to say good morning to her, to hope she had slept
        well, to assure her of his devotion, which he trusted she in some faintest
        manner returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these letters were pleasing to her. She answered the children in a
        cheerful frame of mind, promising them bonbons, and congratulating them
        upon their happy find of the little pigs.
      </p>
      <p>
        She answered her husband with friendly evasiveness,&mdash;not with any
        fixed design to mislead him, only because all sense of reality had gone
        out of her life; she had abandoned herself to Fate, and awaited the
        consequences with indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Arobin&rsquo;s note she made no reply. She put it under Celestine&rsquo;s
        stove-lid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna worked several hours with much spirit. She saw no one but a picture
        dealer, who asked her if it were true that she was going abroad to study
        in Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        She said possibly she might, and he negotiated with her for some Parisian
        studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in December.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert did not come that day. She was keenly disappointed. He did not come
        the following day, nor the next. Each morning she awoke with hope, and
        each night she was a prey to despondency. She was tempted to seek him out.
        But far from yielding to the impulse, she avoided any occasion which might
        throw her in his way. She did not go to Mademoiselle Reisz&rsquo;s nor pass by
        Madame Lebrun&rsquo;s, as she might have done if he had still been in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Arobin, one night, urged her to drive with him, she went&mdash;out to
        the lake, on the Shell Road. His horses were full of mettle, and even a
        little unmanageable. She liked the rapid gait at which they spun along,
        and the quick, sharp sound of the horses&rsquo; hoofs on the hard road. They did
        not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. Arobin was not needlessly imprudent.
        But they ate and they drank when they regained Edna&rsquo;s little dining-room&mdash;which
        was comparatively early in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was late when he left her. It was getting to be more than a passing
        whim with Arobin to see her and be with her. He had detected the latent
        sensuality, which unfolded under his delicate sense of her nature&rsquo;s
        requirements like a torpid, torrid, sensitive blossom.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no despondency when she fell asleep that night; nor was there
        hope when she awoke in the morning.

      <h2>
        XXXVI
      </h2>
      <p>
        There was a garden out in the suburbs; a small, leafy corner, with a few
        green tables under the orange trees. An old cat slept all day on the stone
        step in the sun, and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her
        chair at the open window, till some one happened to knock on one of the
        green tables. She had milk and cream cheese to sell, and bread and butter.
        There was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry a chicken so
        golden brown as she.
      </p>
      <p>
        The place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion,
        and so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of pleasure
        and dissipation. Edna had discovered it accidentally one day when the
        high-board gate stood ajar. She caught sight of a little green table,
        blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering
        leaves overhead. Within she had found the slumbering mulatresse, the
        drowsy cat, and a glass of milk which reminded her of the milk she had
        tasted in Iberville.
      </p>
      <p>
        She often stopped there during her perambulations; sometimes taking a book
        with her, and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she found the
        place deserted. Once or twice she took a quiet dinner there alone, having
        instructed Celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at home. It was the
        last place in the city where she would have expected to meet any one she
        knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still she was not astonished when, as she was partaking of a modest dinner
        late in the afternoon, looking into an open book, stroking the cat, which
        had made friends with her&mdash;she was not greatly astonished to see
        Robert come in at the tall garden gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am destined to see you only by accident,&rdquo; she said, shoving the cat off
        the chair beside her. He was surprised, ill at ease, almost embarrassed at
        meeting her thus so unexpectedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you come here often?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I almost live here,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I used to drop in very often for a cup of Catiche&rsquo;s good coffee. This is
        the first time since I came back.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll bring you a plate, and you will share my dinner. There&rsquo;s always
        enough for two&mdash;even three.&rdquo; Edna had intended to be indifferent and
        as reserved as he when she met him; she had reached the determination by a
        laborious train of reasoning, incident to one of her despondent moods. But
        her resolve melted when she saw him before designing Providence had led
        him into her path.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why have you kept away from me, Robert?&rdquo; she asked, closing the book that
        lay open upon the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are you so personal, Mrs. Pontellier? Why do you force me to idiotic
        subterfuges?&rdquo; he exclaimed with sudden warmth. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s no use
        telling you I&rsquo;ve been very busy, or that I&rsquo;ve been sick, or that I&rsquo;ve been
        to see you and not found you at home. Please let me off with any one of
        these excuses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are the embodiment of selfishness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You save yourself
        something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;but there is some selfish motive,
        and in sparing yourself you never consider for a moment what I think, or
        how I feel your neglect and indifference. I suppose this is what you would
        call unwomanly; but I have got into a habit of expressing myself. It
        doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, and you may think me unwomanly if you like.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I only think you cruel, as I said the other day. Maybe not
        intentionally cruel; but you seem to be forcing me into disclosures which
        can result in nothing; as if you would have me bare a wound for the
        pleasure of looking at it, without the intention or power of healing it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m spoiling your dinner, Robert; never mind what I say. You haven&rsquo;t
        eaten a morsel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I only came in for a cup of coffee.&rdquo; His sensitive face was all
        disfigured with excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a delightful place?&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I am so glad it has never
        actually been discovered. It is so quiet, so sweet, here. Do you notice
        there is scarcely a sound to be heard? It&rsquo;s so out of the way; and a good
        walk from the car. However, I don&rsquo;t mind walking. I always feel so sorry
        for women who don&rsquo;t like to walk; they miss so much&mdash;so many rare
        little glimpses of life; and we women learn so little of life on the
        whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Catiche&rsquo;s coffee is always hot. I don&rsquo;t know how she manages it, here in
        the open air. Celestine&rsquo;s coffee gets cold bringing it from the kitchen to
        the dining-room. Three lumps! How can you drink it so sweet? Take some of
        the cress with your chop; it&rsquo;s so biting and crisp. Then there&rsquo;s the
        advantage of being able to smoke with your coffee out here. Now, in the
        city&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you going to smoke?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;After a while,&rdquo; he said, laying a cigar on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who gave it to you?&rdquo; she laughed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I bought it. I suppose I&rsquo;m getting reckless; I bought a whole box.&rdquo; She
        was determined not to be personal again and make him uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cat made friends with him, and climbed into his lap when he smoked his
        cigar. He stroked her silky fur, and talked a little about her. He looked
        at Edna&rsquo;s book, which he had read; and he told her the end, to save her
        the trouble of wading through it, he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again he accompanied her back to her home; and it was after dusk when they
        reached the little &ldquo;pigeon-house.&rdquo; She did not ask him to remain, which he
        was grateful for, as it permitted him to stay without the discomfort of
        blundering through an excuse which he had no intention of considering. He
        helped her to light the lamp; then she went into her room to take off her
        hat and to bathe her face and hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she came back Robert was not examining the pictures and magazines as
        before; he sat off in the shadow, leaning his head back on the chair as if
        in a reverie. Edna lingered a moment beside the table, arranging the books
        there. Then she went across the room to where he sat. She bent over the
        arm of his chair and called his name.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you asleep?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, looking up at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She leaned over and kissed him&mdash;a soft, cool, delicate kiss, whose
        voluptuous sting penetrated his whole being-then she moved away from him.
        He followed, and took her in his arms, just holding her close to him. She
        put her hand up to his face and pressed his cheek against her own. The
        action was full of love and tenderness. He sought her lips again. Then he
        drew her down upon the sofa beside him and held her hand in both of his.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now you know what I have been fighting against
        since last summer at Grand Isle; what drove me away and drove me back
        again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why have you been fighting against it?&rdquo; she asked. Her face glowed with
        soft lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why? Because you were not free; you were Leonce Pontellier&rsquo;s wife. I
        couldn&rsquo;t help loving you if you were ten times his wife; but so long as I
        went away from you and kept away I could help telling you so.&rdquo; She put her
        free hand up to his shoulder, and then against his cheek, rubbing it
        softly. He kissed her again. His face was warm and flushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There in Mexico I was thinking of you all the time, and longing for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But not writing to me,&rdquo; she interrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Something put into my head that you cared for me; and I lost my senses. I
        forgot everything but a wild dream of your some way becoming my wife.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Religion, loyalty, everything would give way if only you cared.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you must have forgotten that I was Leonce Pontellier&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! I was demented, dreaming of wild, impossible things, recalling men
        who had set their wives free, we have heard of such things.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, we have heard of such things.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I came back full of vague, mad intentions. And when I got here&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When you got here you never came near me!&rdquo; She was still caressing his
        cheek.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I realized what a cur I was to dream of such a thing, even if you had
        been willing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She took his face between her hands and looked into it as if she would
        never withdraw her eyes more. She kissed him on the forehead, the eyes,
        the cheeks, and the lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have been a very, very foolish boy, wasting your time dreaming of
        impossible things when you speak of Mr. Pontellier setting me free! I am
        no longer one of Mr. Pontellier&rsquo;s possessions to dispose of or not. I give
        myself where I choose. If he were to say, &lsquo;Here, Robert, take her and be
        happy; she is yours,&rsquo; I should laugh at you both.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        His face grew a little white. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a knock at the door. Old Celestine came in to say that Madame
        Ratignolle&rsquo;s servant had come around the back way with a message that
        Madame had been taken sick and begged Mrs. Pontellier to go to her
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Edna, rising; &ldquo;I promised. Tell her yes&mdash;to wait for
        me. I&rsquo;ll go back with her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me walk over with you,&rdquo; offered Robert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will go with the servant.&rdquo; She went into her room to
        put on her hat, and when she came in again she sat once more upon the sofa
        beside him. He had not stirred. She put her arms about his neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-by, my sweet Robert. Tell me good-by.&rdquo; He kissed her with a degree
        of passion which had not before entered into his caress, and strained her
        to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;only you; no one but you. It was you who
        awoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have made
        me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered! Now
        you are here we shall love each other, my Robert. We shall be everything
        to each other. Nothing else in the world is of any consequence. I must go
        to my friend; but you will wait for me? No matter how late; you will wait
        for me, Robert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go; don&rsquo;t go! Oh! Edna, stay with me,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Why should you
        go? Stay with me, stay with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here.&rdquo; She buried
        her face in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice,
        together with his great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had
        deprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXVII
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna looked in at the drug store. Monsieur Ratignolle was putting up a
        mixture himself, very carefully, dropping a red liquid into a tiny glass.
        He was grateful to Edna for having come; her presence would be a comfort
        to his wife. Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s sister, who had always been with her at
        such trying times, had not been able to come up from the plantation, and
        Adele had been inconsolable until Mrs. Pontellier so kindly promised to
        come to her. The nurse had been with them at night for the past week, as
        she lived a great distance away. And Dr. Mandelet had been coming and
        going all the afternoon. They were then looking for him any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna hastened upstairs by a private stairway that led from the rear of the
        store to the apartments above. The children were all sleeping in a back
        room. Madame Ratignolle was in the salon, whither she had strayed in her
        suffering impatience. She sat on the sofa, clad in an ample white
        peignoir, holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a nervous clutch.
        Her face was drawn and pinched, her sweet blue eyes haggard and unnatural.
        All her beautiful hair had been drawn back and plaited. It lay in a long
        braid on the sofa pillow, coiled like a golden serpent. The nurse, a
        comfortable looking Griffe woman in white apron and cap, was urging her to
        return to her bedroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is no use, there is no use,&rdquo; she said at once to Edna. &ldquo;We must get
        rid of Mandelet; he is getting too old and careless. He said he would be
        here at half-past seven; now it must be eight. See what time it is,
        Josephine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman was possessed of a cheerful nature, and refused to take any
        situation too seriously, especially a situation with which she was so
        familiar. She urged Madame to have courage and patience. But Madame only
        set her teeth hard into her under lip, and Edna saw the sweat gather in
        beads on her white forehead. After a moment or two she uttered a profound
        sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a ball. She
        appeared exhausted. The nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief, sprinkled
        with cologne water.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is too much!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Mandelet ought to be killed! Where is
        Alphonse? Is it possible I am to be abandoned like this&mdash;neglected by
        every one?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Neglected, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the nurse. Wasn&rsquo;t she there? And here was
        Mrs. Pontellier leaving, no doubt, a pleasant evening at home to devote to
        her? And wasn&rsquo;t Monsieur Ratignolle coming that very instant through the
        hall? And Josephine was quite sure she had heard Doctor Mandelet&rsquo;s coupe.
        Yes, there it was, down at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adele consented to go back to her room. She sat on the edge of a little
        low couch next to her bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doctor Mandelet paid no attention to Madame Ratignolle&rsquo;s upbraidings. He
        was accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of her
        loyalty to doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was glad to see Edna, and wanted her to go with him into the salon and
        entertain him. But Madame Ratignolle would not consent that Edna should
        leave her for an instant. Between agonizing moments, she chatted a little,
        and said it took her mind off her sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna began to feel uneasy. She was seized with a vague dread. Her own like
        experiences seemed far away, unreal, and only half remembered. She
        recalled faintly an ecstasy of pain, the heavy odor of chloroform, a
        stupor which had deadened sensation, and an awakening to find a little new
        life to which she had given being, added to the great unnumbered multitude
        of souls that come and go.
      </p>
      <p>
        She began to wish she had not come; her presence was not necessary. She
        might have invented a pretext for staying away; she might even invent a
        pretext now for going. But Edna did not go. With an inward agony, with a
        flaming, outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature, she witnessed the
        scene of torture.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned
        over her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by. Adele, pressing her
        cheek, whispered in an exhausted voice: &ldquo;Think of the children, Edna. Oh
        think of the children! Remember them!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXVIII
      </h2>
      <p>
        Edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air. The Doctor&rsquo;s
        coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere. She did not
        wish to enter the coupe, and told Doctor Mandelet she would walk; she was
        not afraid, and would go alone. He directed his carriage to meet him at
        Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s, and he started to walk home with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up&mdash;away up, over the narrow street between the tall houses, the
        stars were blazing. The air was mild and caressing, but cool with the
        breath of spring and the night. They walked slowly, the Doctor with a
        heavy, measured tread and his hands behind him; Edna, in an absent-minded
        way, as she had walked one night at Grand Isle, as if her thoughts had
        gone ahead of her and she was striving to overtake them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have been there, Mrs. Pontellier,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was no
        place for you. Adele is full of whims at such times. There were a dozen
        women she might have had with her, unimpressionable women. I felt that it
        was cruel, cruel. You shouldn&rsquo;t have gone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; she answered, indifferently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it matters
        after all. One has to think of the children some time or other; the sooner
        the better.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When is Leonce coming back?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite soon. Some time in March.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you are going abroad?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;no, I am not going. I&rsquo;m not going to be forced into doing
        things. I don&rsquo;t want to go abroad. I want to be let alone. Nobody has any
        right&mdash;except children, perhaps&mdash;and even then, it seems to me&mdash;or
        it did seem&mdash;&rdquo; She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency
        of her thoughts, and stopped abruptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively,
        &ldquo;that youth is given up to illusions. It seems to be a provision of
        Nature; a decoy to secure mothers for the race. And Nature takes no
        account of moral consequences, of arbitrary conditions which we create,
        and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The years that are gone seem like dreams&mdash;if one
        might go on sleeping and dreaming&mdash;but to wake up and find&mdash;oh!
        well! perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather
        than to remain a dupe to illusions all one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me, my dear child,&rdquo; said the Doctor at parting, holding her
        hand, &ldquo;you seem to me to be in trouble. I am not going to ask for your
        confidence. I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to me,
        perhaps I might help you. I know I would understand. And I tell you there
        are not many who would&mdash;not many, my dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Some way I don&rsquo;t feel moved to speak of things that trouble me. Don&rsquo;t
        think I am ungrateful or that I don&rsquo;t appreciate your sympathy. There are
        periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me. But I
        don&rsquo;t want anything but my own way. That is wanting a good deal, of
        course, when you have to trample upon the lives, the hearts, the
        prejudices of others&mdash;but no matter&mdash;still, I shouldn&rsquo;t want to
        trample upon the little lives. Oh! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying, Doctor.
        Good night. Don&rsquo;t blame me for anything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I will blame you if you don&rsquo;t come and see me soon. We will talk of
        things you never have dreamt of talking about before. It will do us both
        good. I don&rsquo;t want you to blame yourself, whatever comes. Good night, my
        child.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She let herself in at the gate, but instead of entering she sat upon the
        step of the porch. The night was quiet and soothing. All the tearing
        emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a somber,
        uncomfortable garment, which she had but to loosen to be rid of. She went
        back to that hour before Adele had sent for her; and her senses kindled
        afresh in thinking of Robert&rsquo;s words, the pressure of his arms, and the
        feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture at that moment no
        greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one. His expression
        of love had already given him to her in part. When she thought that he was
        there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication of
        expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep perhaps. She would awaken
        him with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him
        with her caresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, she remembered Adele&rsquo;s voice whispering, &ldquo;Think of the children;
        think of them.&rdquo; She meant to think of them; that determination had driven
        into her soul like a death wound&mdash;but not to-night. To-morrow would
        be time to think of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at
        hand. The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that
        lay in the lamplight:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I love you. Good-by&mdash;because I love you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna grew faint when she read the words. She went and sat on the sofa.
        Then she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound. She did not
        sleep. She did not go to bed. The lamp sputtered and went out. She was
        still awake in the morning, when Celestine unlocked the kitchen door and
        came in to light the fire.
      </p>
      <h2>
        XXXIX
      </h2>
      <p>
        Victor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a
        corner of one of the galleries. Mariequita sat near by, dangling her legs,
        watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box. The sun was
        beating down upon them. The girl had covered her head with her apron
        folded into a square pad. They had been talking for an hour or more. She
        was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs.
        Pontellier&rsquo;s. He exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable
        Lucullean feast. The flowers were in tubs, he said. The champagne was
        quaffed from huge golden goblets. Venus rising from the foam could have
        presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier, blazing
        with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board, while the other women
        were all of them youthful houris, possessed of incomparable charms. She
        got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier, and he
        gave her evasive answers, framed so as to confirm her belief. She grew
        sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off and leave him to his fine
        ladies. There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere; and since
        it was the fashion to be in love with married people, why, she could run
        away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina&rsquo;s husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        Celina&rsquo;s husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to her,
        Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he
        encountered him. This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita. She
        dried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life
        when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house. The
        two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to
        be an apparition. But it was really she in flesh and blood, looking tired
        and a little travel-stained.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I walked up from the wharf,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and heard the hammering. I
        supposed it was you, mending the porch. It&rsquo;s a good thing. I was always
        tripping over those loose planks last summer. How dreary and deserted
        everything looks!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in
        Beaudelet&rsquo;s lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to
        rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing fixed up yet, you see. I&rsquo;ll give you my room; it&rsquo;s the
        only place.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Any corner will do,&rdquo; she assured him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if you can stand Philomel&rsquo;s cooking,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;though I might try
        to get her mother while you are here. Do you think she would come?&rdquo;
        turning to Mariequita.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel&rsquo;s mother might come for a few
        days, and money enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once
        suspected a lovers&rsquo; rendezvous. But Victor&rsquo;s astonishment was so genuine,
        and Mrs. Pontellier&rsquo;s indifference so apparent, that the disturbing notion
        did not lodge long in her brain. She contemplated with the greatest
        interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America, and
        who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What time will you have dinner?&rdquo; asked Edna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very hungry; but don&rsquo;t
        get anything extra.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it ready in little or no time,&rdquo; he said, bustling and packing
        away his tools. &ldquo;You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself.
        Mariequita will show you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;But, do you know, I have a notion to go down to
        the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The water is too cold!&rdquo; they both exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I might go down and try&mdash;dip my toes in. Why, it seems to me
        the sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean. Could
        you get me a couple of towels? I&rsquo;d better go right away, so as to be back
        in time. It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this afternoon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mariequita ran over to Victor&rsquo;s room, and returned with some towels, which
        she gave to Edna.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope you have fish for dinner,&rdquo; said Edna, as she started to walk away;
        &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t do anything extra if you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Run and find Philomel&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; Victor instructed the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to
        the kitchen and see what I can do. By Gimminy! Women have no
        consideration! She might have sent me word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing
        anything special except that the sun was hot. She was not dwelling upon
        any particular train of thought. She had done all the thinking which was
        necessary after Robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa till
        morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had said over and over to herself: &ldquo;To-day it is Arobin; to-morrow it
        will be some one else. It makes no difference to me, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
        about Leonce Pontellier&mdash;but Raoul and Etienne!&rdquo; She understood now
        clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Adele Ratignolle that
        she would give up the unessential, but she would never sacrifice herself
        for her children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never
        lifted. There was no one thing in the world that she desired. There was no
        human being whom she wanted near her except Robert; and she even realized
        that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of him would melt
        out of her existence, leaving her alone. The children appeared before her
        like antagonists who had overcome her; who had overpowered and sought to
        drag her into the soul&rsquo;s slavery for the rest of her days. But she knew a
        way to elude them. She was not thinking of these things when she walked
        down to the beach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The water of the Gulf stretched out before her, gleaming with the million
        lights of the sun. The voice of the sea is seductive, never ceasing,
        whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander in abysses
        of solitude. All along the white beach, up and down, there was no living
        thing in sight. A bird with a broken wing was beating the air above,
        reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging, faded, upon its
        accustomed peg.
      </p>
      <p>
        She put it on, leaving her clothing in the bath-house. But when she was
        there beside the sea, absolutely alone, she cast the unpleasant, pricking
        garments from her, and for the first time in her life she stood naked in
        the open air, at the mercy of the sun, the breeze that beat upon her, and
        the waves that invited her.
      </p>
      <p>
        How strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how
        delicious! She felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a
        familiar world that it had never known.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents
        about her ankles. She walked out. The water was chill, but she walked on.
        The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a
        long, sweeping stroke. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the
        body in its soft, close embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        She went on and on. She remembered the night she swam far out, and
        recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain
        the shore. She did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the
        blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing
        that it had no beginning and no end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her arms and legs were growing tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        She thought of Leonce and the children. They were a part of her life. But
        they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and soul. How
        Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she knew! &ldquo;And
        you call yourself an artist! What pretensions, Madame! The artist must
        possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-by&mdash;because I love you.&rdquo; He did not know; he did not
        understand. He would never understand. Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have
        understood if she had seen him&mdash;but it was too late; the shore was
        far behind her, and her strength was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        She looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an instant,
        then sank again. Edna heard her father&rsquo;s voice and her sister Margaret&rsquo;s.
        She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree.
        The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch.
        There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks filled the air.
