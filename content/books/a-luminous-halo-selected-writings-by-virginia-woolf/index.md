## FOREWORD

I have spent nearly five decades reading and rereading Virginia Woolf—what she wrote, what has been written about her, and what has been written about what she wrote. I cannot get enough. I chase after her words and thoughts with my hair “flying back like the tail of a racehorse,” attempting to grasp her meaning and understand the working of her mind and imagination.

In 1977, I purchased my first Woolf novel, *Mrs. Dalloway*.  It is a “Book of the Month” edition, no introduction, no notes. I had no idea of the worlds within worlds of *Mrs. Dalloway*, nor did I have any grasp of the scope of everything Woolf created in her lifetime. But I was captured and held fast by the rhythm, the musicality, the wit, and poetry within her prose. For the next thirty years, while raising three children and building a career in healthcare regulatory compliance, I continued reading Woolf’s novels and short stories. Then, ten years ago, life presented me with the gift of a teacher and friend in J.J. Wilson: Professor Emerita, Sonoma State University; instrumental in bringing Woolf back into the academic conversation; co-founder of the *[Virginia Woolf Miscellany](<https://virginiawoolfmiscellany.wordpress.com/ >)* and of the [Sitting Room Library](https://sittingroomlibrary.org/). 

The *Virginia Woolf Miscellany (VWM)* was first published in 1973, with the goal of bringing attention to the work of Virginia Woolf and facilitating an ongoing conversation in which scholars, teachers, students, and common readers could learn from one another. What began as a newsletter with a modest circulation has grown over the years. *VWM* is now a sizable journal publishing articles, selected essays from conferences, poems, artwork, and reviews under the guidance of Professor Vara Neverow of Southern Connecticut State University and a dedicated editorial board. 

The Sitting Room Library, inspired by the Morrison Reading Room at the UC Berkeley University Library, began as a place for people to gather, hold salons, and celebrate the cultural contributions of women artists and writers. The library's collection of books began with donations provided by early visitors and volunteers and has expanded to include over 7,000 titles showcasing feminist writing, art, and thought. 

When I retired, I began attending events at the Sitting Room, including poetry readings and writing workshops. I was soon invited to join the group of volunteers that keep the library going by serving as librarians, archivists, historians, facilitators, and more.  J.J. offered me the assignment of maintaining the ever-expanding Woolf library collection: the Woolf Wall — a dedicated area of the library that houses nearly 600 books by and about Virginia Woolf alongside all 101 issues of the *VWM*.  In the Archives you will find endless treasures, such as set directions for a dramatic reading of The Waves, presented at the 1974 Virginia Woolf Symposium at University of California Santa Cruz; photocopies of notes and illustrations from Virginia Woolf’s notebooks for *Three Guineas* taken on a trip long ago to Monks House; and documents, articles, essays, and correspondence from Woolf scholars and readers collected over the past fifty years.

The Woolf Wall is a mecca for lovers of Woolf, providing exposure to and immersion in the numerous biographies and critical studies of Woolf’s writing.  As I took on my new responsibilities as the curator of the Woolf Wall, I read several biographies including *Virginia Woolf* by Hermione Lee and *Virginia Woolf: A Writer's Life* by Lyndall Gordon. Then I ‘dipped my beak’ into the critical studies, beginning with *The Interrupted Moment: A View of Woolf’s Novels* by Lucio P. Ruotolo, and discovered that the critical studies were very accessible to a “Common Reader” like me. After all, Woolf named two collections after the common reader, and Woolf scholars, like Woolf, share a respect for readers who are not scholars or critics but read for themselves. 

As the books and essays piled up on my shelves and my notes accumulated in unruly piles, it occurred to me that a select few of the numerous essays and short stories written by Woolf were frequently referenced by scholars. I have at least one, if not several, copies of books cthat containthese specific works —*The Common Reader*, *Granite and Rainbow*, and *The Death of the Moth*, etc.— on my shelves. But I wanted to have them all in one volume, to move uninterrupted through Woolf’s imagination, chase her thoughts, capture them in my heart and mind and experience the rapture of grasping life, if only for a moment.  One day, I made a list of these essential writings, which has become the table of contents of this modest collection.

There is much to gain from spending time tracing the lines of thought that led Woolf to distill so much truth into her fiction.  In “Modern Fiction,” which Mark Hussey, in his so-useful Virginia Woolf A-Z, cites as Woolf’s best known and most oft-quoted essay, Woolf examines the notion that the current great novels do not reflect ‘life itself.’ She implores writers to escape from the previous forms of the novel in search of models that can capture something real, writing:

> \
> Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; but a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end. Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible?

Given what we know about how Woolf and other women writers continue to be criticized for the subjects they write about, the essay ends with the prescient statement: ‘The proper stuff of fiction’ does not exist; everything is the proper stuff of fiction.’”    

In each of these works, readers can join Woolf in exploring a range of ideas and approaches to the novel and what she is trying to accomplish with her own writing.  Often referred to as ‘one of the most influential manifestos of literary modernism,’ the essay “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown” looks at how character-making is evolving as an essential literary function. Woolf asserts a need to move away from minute outside details, questioning the notion of how best to express character in fiction and the meaning of ‘reality.’  And I take  great comfort in the advice Woolf gives in “How Should One Read A Book” which is to take no advice and follow your own instincts. 

This collection ends not with an essay, but a short story—the first Woolf ever published, and published by her own Hogarth Press. In a letter to Ethel Smyth, (16 October 1930), Woolf writes: ‘I shall never forget the day I wrote The Mark on the Wall – all in a flash, as if flying …’  Reading “The Mark on the Wall” taught me  ‘how to read Woolf,’ and indeed, how to read, in general.  Taking cues from “How Should One Read A Book,” when I read, I let the story take me where the story is going, open my mind as wide as possible and, “try to become him {the author}.”  With Woolf’s guidance, I am a “fellow-worker and accomplice” to the writers whose worlds I enter.     

My hope is that this selection of Woolf’s writings will be a welcome addition to the shelves of those who want to explore the ideas and challenges that ignited Woolf’s creative imagination—to dig into all the “proper stuff” of life and art.

One of the themes explored in Woolf’s most famous nonfiction work, *A Room of One’s Own*, and in some of the works collected here, is the issue of access.  Access to knowledge, information, and education. Between 1922 and 1938 Woolf published seven novels, one biography, the book-length essays *A Room of One’s Own* and *Three Guineas*, and two collections of essays.  Over the next ten years, Woolf’s work will continue to move into the public domain in more countries, increasing awareness and expanding access to her canon. I am certain that Woolf would be pleased with this project created by a Common Reader and made available to Common Readers via Cita Press, a library open to all with no barriers or closed doors to keep anyone out.
